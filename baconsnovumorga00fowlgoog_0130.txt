mente Francisci Bacenis Verulamii, et ejus sequentium vestigia!
Here and elsewhere he is profuse in his praise of Bacon.

Boerhaave, who, as Mr. Napier says, was himself an eminent
improver of science in several of its branehes, and who was placed
in a situation, which, in a particular manner, enabled him to collect
the general sentiment of Europe upon any point connected with the
history os philosophy, in his Discourse de comparando certo iu
Physicis, delivered before the University of Leyden in. 17¹5, pro-
nounced an eulogium on Bacon which it would be difficult to exceede
‘Atque hujus quidem Physices fortunas laudare licet ex quo magnum
Verulamium summo suo bono aceepit! Virum certe ad omnia, quae
scientia humana. comprehendi possunt, indaganda facile principem,
et de quo dubites utrum consilio, an exemplo, maJ‘or fuerit in in-
mutanda deformata Physioe. Absque invidia dixero, quidquid
incrementi cepit naturalis historia ab ineunte decimo sexto seculo
in hanc usque horam, omne id acceptum debemus monitis et pre-
ceptis illius viri; cujus indelibilem memoriam grata colet orbis
perpetuitas!

Similar is the testimony of Buddaeus (Compendium Historiae
Philosophicae, Ed. os 173 1, pp. ⁴09-41²)2 ‘Saeculo decimo septimo
ineunte, nova lux philosophiae, praesertim in seientia naturali, om
est. Exemplum omnibus praeivit Franciscus Baco de Verulamio,
qui, ut, missis abstractis illis et otiosis speculationibus, ad partimini-ia
descenderent experimentaque instituendo naturam rerum accusatiu-
contemplarentur, omnibus auctor fuit. Hujus ductum eum multi
sequerentur, dici nou potest, quanta ad accuratiorem philosophiam
sacta sit accessio!

Morbos (Polyhistor‚ tom. i. lib. 2. cap. 7) speaks of a work,
published in Hungary in 1663, by one John Beyer, entitletl “Filum
Labyrinthi vel Cynosura, sive Lux mentium universalis,' ke.. in which
the author attempted to expound the Bacunian philosophy. ‘Verum
obscurat potius Verulamii sensus omnemque philosophiam, quam ut
lumen aliquod accendat? This fact is interesting as showing that
the sume οῖ nacon’s philosophieal reform had reassched even remote
countries like Hungasy.

On the possible, or, perhaps, probable influence of Bacon’s vri-itingo
on the institution of scientific societies abroad, Ι shall have oce-sion
to speak in a note on the next division of my subject.
