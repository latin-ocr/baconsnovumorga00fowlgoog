os these respeets, the method of Bacon is to be found embodied in
the teaching and example of Aristone, and even of Socrate· and
Plato. Induction of some sort or other, and, consequenth, the
emnfination and collection os saeta, is as old as human reasouing.
This object gave me pleasure or pain yesterday, and. therefore, 1 will
pur-sne or avoid ε. similar object to-day3 or 1 compat-,sed rny ends
in this way yesterday, and. therefore, 1 will try a similar mode again
to-dny, are amongst the earlIest thoughts which would occur to man.
Itis, therefore, os course, absurd to represent Baton ns the author or
discover-er os Induction. What logicians have done is not to invent
forms os reasoning, but to anabrse, criticise‚ and offer rules and
cautious sor secur-ing the due perronnance of those which already exist.
Hence, it would be utterly superfluous to accumulate early inmunes
of inductive reasoning; as respects my present purpose, it is quite
sufficient to refer to the ὁτακτικοὶ λόγοι or παραβολὴ os Socrates ⁸,
and to give a very brief account of Asistotle's method, eo far as it
:elates to the present question.

To my mind nothing can be clearer than that Aristode rests all
evidence ultimately on the observation of individua} facte. See, for
instance, Metaph. i. 1, Post. Αη, ii. ¹9· And, in accordante with this
doctrine, the ultimate major premiss os any train of deductive
reasoning must itself rest on an induction from particulam. Ἐκ

ἰ. ι8. Unronunately, Aristone went no further in his sonna] analysis
of induction than to reduce it to the syllogistie type, and, as an almost
necessary consequence of this procedure, he required an exhaustive
enumeration os all the' instaneae (Inductio per Enumerationem Sim·
plicem or Inductio completa). Δεῖ δὲ νοεῖν τὸ 1· τὸ ἐξ Mne-vro»- καθ’

in most cases, it was impossible to satissy this requirement in practice.
