Liebig's onsslaught on Baton (Ueber Francis Bwon von νει-πίω)
appeared both in German and in English in 1863, and was followed
by a keen controversy between Liebig and Sigwart. (See the next
aectiou, on the Bibliogrsphy οἰ the Novum Organum.) The ooension
of this work was Liebig's anuoyance at the rejection of some of his
chemical theorica by English agriculmrists. Their singulas obstinacy
must, he thought. be due to some inherent desect in the English
mind, and this suspicion led him to the study of the English phi·
loseph-ers. When, at last, he eume to the works of Bneon, all was
clear. These furnished, if not the source, at least the typioel example
ns the methnds of experiment and reasoning common amongst the
English dilettanfi, who had had the temerity to reject his theoria.
The study of Eacon thus acquired the charm os a scientific discovery}
the writer, he tells us, went much deeper than before into the subJeet,
ancl, hence. the work before us (see Preface to German Edition).

bitter in tone, and osten very inaccurate, eontributes nothing to the
knowledge or appreciation os Bacon's philosophy. 12 repens the
thread-bare arguments employed by Brewster and Lassora, but with
an amount os exaggeration and asperity which is utterly foreign
to the second. and would, 1 think, have been distasteful even to the

Maistxe or Stubbe. Thus (Ι quote fromtheEnglish texo: ‘Bacenis eou-
