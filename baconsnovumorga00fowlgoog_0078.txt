’ effetas from canses. According to the other conception, it in the hv·
according to which the phenomenon in question is developed out of
pre-existing conditione, or, taking into acoount the conditione, it in, in

l brief, its cause. But, practically (and the pranticnl intereat ia 'iffi
Baton, we must recollect, always supreme), these two compono·
may, is we take a sufficiently sanguine view of human power, be
regarded as leading to the same result. Given the aggregate of
primnry and unden’ved attributes, and we are able to produce the
phenomenon, or, rather, it follows as a matter of course. Given tho
preaexisu'ng conditione and the law of their development, and (on the
important assumption that we are able to put this law in aetion, that
we possess an ¹ efficiens' as a 'vehiculum formae’) we are ourselvfl
able to produce the effect. Thus, the knowledge of the essenee (in
the sense which 1 bave attached to that word) and the knowledge of
the canuae are, sor all practical pus-posca, the same ⁸⁹. If, to take
Bacon's instantes, we know that beat consiste in a certain kind of
motion, or whiteness in a certain juxtaposition of partiales¹ we tue
already acquainted with the law of its development or muse os ite
production. Or, ιο take Lasalle's instance of ‘Form' (which soemo
ιο me a very good one), if we are acquainted with Newton's amlynin
os a white ray of light into the several coloured mys of which it is
composed, it is indifferent whether we speak of these rays ns consti·
tuting ( ει being the essence of) whiteness, or as producing ( = being
the cause os) whiteness. And, as substances or concrete bodies were,
according to Bacon's conception, ‘ formae copulatae: or combinatione
of certain ‘simple natures,¹ a knowledge os the ‘essence’ would, in
their case also, be equivalent to a knowledge of the ‘causo' So sur,
indeed, did Baton carry this idea that he supposed that, is we could
ever attain (as he did not despair os attaining) to a knowledge of the
various ‘simple natures' which constitute oubatames, we should be
able, by superimposing them severally, one on the other, to pmduoe
the substance in question. See, for instance, the beginning of the
5th Aphorism oi the Second Book of the Novum Organum, which
furnishes a good example both os the simplicity which he ascribed to
Nature aud οἱ the sanguine expectatione which he had formed of our
ultimate power over its operatione.
