pam at so early an age, that we are hardly consciens of having ever gone
through theru. Hence, we are able almost at once to construet definitione
for the purpoee os explaining the most important distinctions which we
either find obtruded οη our notice, or think it desii-able to establish-
Moreoven these definitivus, when coustructed, do not pretend to repment
concrete facts but only certain abstract relations of figures and numbers.
That such relations exist, if not strictly, at last appmximately. no one
disputes3 they can, generally be expressed in a few words, which adequately
and exhaustively represent them, and a single technical term Ε easily
invented or apmpriated, by means of which the definition can in futme
be summoned before the mind. About the adequacy or conecto& of
these definitions there is seldom any differeuce of opinion, and, even it*
there be, it does not affect the validity of the subsequent reasoninffi for,
provided that the same relation be invariably designat-ed by the same
name, and that the logical operations be correctly performed, there απ
be no error iu the result. But, when we corne to deal with the complex
relations of nature and life, it is widely different. Here. Induction oceu-
pies a far more important piace, and tili we have :scenaincss distinguished,
and classified the more important properties of the objects under inventi-
gmon, it is in vain to begin the work of Definitum. lt is only aster
we have compieted the inducti-te stage of the enquiry that we are in a
position to draw up a list ni definitions, or, if we venture to do so before,
we ought to regard them simply as incompleterand pmvisional, and hold
ourselves iu constant readiness to review and correct them. Hence.
while the inductive stage of a sciente is pmgreaeive, and therefore
incomptae, it is natural that much controversy should turn on the
definitione. ¹ it is necessary: as Bacon says, 'to be constantly reem-ring
to particular instances,· and we cannot saseiy reason deductively from
the definitions ns dau, tili we have firmly established the inductions on

which they rest, and of which they are frequently the expresa’ons, md,
indeed, the summaries.
