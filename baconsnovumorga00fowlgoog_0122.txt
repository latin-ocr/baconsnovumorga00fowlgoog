Gaesendi (who was, in many respeess, n precursor of Locke, ond
whom that philosopher appears to have cnrefully studied) given in his
book De Logicae Origine et Varietate, cap. ro, a somewhnt elabornte
account of the contente of the Novum Organnm, while, in cap. rr. he
compares it favourably with the Logic of Descertes. In the book 'De
Logicnc Fine, cup. 6, he recurs to the subject, Itis plain that he sympa-
thisee wamly with Bacon¹s airus and efforts: ‘Ausu vere Hernico novam
tentare viam est ausus, sperareque sore ut, modo illi strenue diligen-
terque insistatur, nova tandem eaque perfecta condi haberique Philo·
sophia possit! Descartes is spoken of as imitating Bncon in the
destructive part of his method, and praised accordingly. But. in the
constructive parts, their methode diverged ns widely as could he:

‘In another work ' (Ι here quote from Mr. Macvey anier), ‘his
valuable account οῖ his celebrated friend Peiresc [contained in vol. v.
of Gessendi's works], there is a passage in which Bacon is mentioned
in a way particularly deserving of notice in the present discussion.
“No rnan,¹' says Gussendi, speaking of his friend, “made more obser-
vations, or caused more ‘to be made. to the end, that at last some
notione os natural things, ruore sound and pure than those commonly
received, might be collected; for which reason he admired the genius»
and approved the desig-n of that great chancellor os England, Sir
Francis Bacon.'¹ Now, Peiresc died in 1637, only eleven years aster
Bacon. But this is not all. He was the first man in Frnnce, according
to Bainy. who deserved the name os an astronomen and he, ns well
