Under this head, 1 propone only to give some examplee of the
various grounds of opposition or disparagement to which the
Baconian philosophy has been subiectum, thinking that, though far
from exhaustive. they will be of some interest to the reader.

Perhaps, 1 ought first to notice a letter from Sir Thomas Bodley
(originally published in Bacon's Remains, 1648, pp. 85-87), ‘to Sir
Francis Bacon, about his Cogitata et Visa, when-ein he declarem bis
opinion sreely menching the same! 'l'he writer, who has evidently a
great affection for the old learning, is somewhat scnndalised by Bwon's
revolutionary sentimum, and thinks that if we ‘come habes nd

regnum naturae, as we are willed by Scriptures to come ad regnum
coelorum, there is nothing more certain than that it would instantly
bring us to Barbas-ism, and aster many thousand years leuve us more
unprovided of theorican sumitate than we are at mispreseun' 'rhe
