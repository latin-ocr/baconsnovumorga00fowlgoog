the Dedicaflon, he thus describes his design and the character tf the
present instalruent: ‘Primitiae Historiae nostrae Naturalis celsitudini
tuae humillime offero, Rem mole perpusillam. veluti Granum sinapis:
sed tamen pignus eorum, quae Deo volente sequentur. obstrinximus
enim nos ipsos tanquam voto. singulis nos mensibus, ad quos Dei
bonitas (cujus agitur Gloria tanquam in cantico novo) vitam nostram
produxerit, unam, aut plures ejus partes, prout fuerint magis aut
minus arduae, aut copiosae, confecturos, et edituros. Moti etiam
sortasse erunt alii, nostro exemplo, ad similem industriam: praesertim
postquam penitus perspexerim, quid agatur. Nam in Historia Natu-
rali bona, et bene instituta, clavis sunt et Scientiarum et Operum.¹
This volume contains only general prefatory remarks, the Historia
Ventorum, and an Aditus to each os the following proposed treatises:
Historia Densi et Rari; Historia Gravis et Levis3 Historia Sym-
pathiae et Antipathiae Rerum ; Historia Sulphuris, Mercurii. et Satin
and Historia Vitae et Mortis. These five ‘Historiae' were to follow
the Historia Ventorum at intervals of a month. It appears that the
volume containing the Historia Ventorum was published about the
beginning os November, 16223 the Historia Vitae et Mortis about
{he end os the following January‚ 1622-3¹². The reason for bringing
out the latter book before the sour intermediam ones is stated to be
‘propter eximiam rei utilitatem in qua vel minima temporis jactura
pro pretiosa haberi debet! The Historia Densi et Rari did not
appear till the publication of Dr. Rawiey's opuscula Varia Posthurna
in 1⁶58. It goes overa good deal of the same ground as a tract,
entitled Phaenomena Universa, published by Gruter in 1⁶53 ¹³. The

remaining three subjects Bacon does not appear to have handled, at
least in separate treatises.

The Sylva Sylvarum, which is a miscellaneous collection of obaer-
vations and experimenta, taken mainly from books, was not published
till after Baeon's death. 1t was edited by Rawley in ¹⁶27· Eat-on
having died in 1626. Interesting in many respecta as this collection
is, it is the least creditable of Bacon's philosophica] works, and has
furnished Liebig and other antagonists with many of their most
effective weaponS. In fact, as Bacon is reported by Rawley to have
said himself, ‘if he should have served the glory of his own Name, he
had been better not to have published this Natural History! Iu my
