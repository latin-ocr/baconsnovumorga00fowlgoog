be two swords amongst Christians, the spiritual and tempnunt: md
both have their due office and place in the maimenanoe of religion.

But we may not take up the third swerd, which is Mabomet's word,

or like unte it; that is, to propagate religion by wars or by ammiras-y
persecutione ω soree conscience85 except it be in maes of ovat
madal, bhaphemy, or intermixtum of practice against the mte3
much less to nourish seditions ; to authorise oonspimcies and rebel-
lions; to put the sword into the people's lnnds3 and the like: tending

to the subversion of all govemment, which is the ordinante οῖ
God. For this is but to dash the first table against mesecond3

and so to consider men ns Christians, as we forget thet they m
men. Lucretius the poet, when he beheld the act οἰ Agamemnon,

that could endure the sacrificing os his own daughter, exclahned:

Tantum Remigio potuit suadere malorum:

What would he have said, if he had known os the mnssacre in

descend to the cruel and execrable actions os marthering princes
butehery of people, and subversion of states and governments?
Surely this is to bring down the Holy Ghost, instead of the like-
ness of a dove, in the shape of a vulmre or raven-15 and eet out
of the burk os a Christian church a flag of a bark of pirates md
Assassins. Theresore it is most necessary that {he chnrch by doctrine
and decree, princes by their swerd, and au learnings, both Christian
and moral¹ as by their Mercury rod, do damn and send ιο hell for

religion, that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed, Ira hmini
non ampletjusmiam Dei. And it was a notable observation of a wine
