ᾗ 11. THE CAUSES OF ARISTOTLE'S FAILURE m ms
ansmm, RESEARCHES.

Amongst the various causes thch have been assigned for Aris-
totle's comparative sailure in this branch os his philosophy are the
neglect of facts (or, as it has been otherwise phrased, his disregard of
experienee), a partiality for abstract reasoning, a want of distinctness
and os appropriateness to the facts in the Ideas he employs, and the
absence of verification. Of the first, it may be shewn (as has been
abundantly done by Dr. Whewell in his History of the Inductive
Sciences and by Mr. G. H. Lewes in his work on Aristotle, and as
will be obvious to any one acquainted with Aristotle's physioel
treatises), that it is very inaecurately stated. Aristone, especially in
his History of Animals, has collected a very large number os facts,
though the facts may not always be well selected or precisely de-
scribed. As to the second charge, not only does it err in vagueness,
but it may be met with a plea os justification. ‘Abstract reasoning,'
provided it be properly conducted, is quite as essential a factor of
seleuce, as is the accumulation of facts. The third charge (which is
that advanced by Dr. Whewell θ’) is certainly well-grounded, but it
specifies, as it appears to me, only one of many causes, while it leaves
unanswered the question, ¹ Why are Aristotle's ideas inappropriate to
his facts?', one of the very problems to be solved. Nor does it seem
to me that the fourth cause (which is that assigned by Mr. Lewes iu
his work on Aristotle) supplies an adequate explanation. For what
is Verification? It is the confirmation of one mode of proof by
another, as, for instance, of induction by deductim, or of deduction
by induction. But, though Aristotle's reasoning is undoubtedly osten

rejection os Final Cnuses, which possesses rnuch value or discrimination, is to be
found in Dugald Stewart's Elements, part ii. subdivision ι. ch. 4. sect. 6 (Ed.
Hamilton. Works. vol. iii. pp. 335-357). Much os what Stewart says would nove

require to be re-cast, in view of the facts and theory of Evolution. But the
student will still find his remarks os considerable interest.
