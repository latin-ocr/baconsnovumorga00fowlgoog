Scripturis saeris, philosophiam neutralem fundare eonati sint: hm*
viva quaerentes mortua. 'ramoque magis haec vanitas inhibenda
venit, et coercenda, quin ex divinorum et humanorum malesana nd-
mistione, non sotum educitur philosophia phantastica, sed otiam
religio haeretica. Itaque salutare admodum. est, si mente sobria
fidei tantum dentur quae fidei sunt-¹ In the latter he says, speaking
ol* the causes of the slight progress hitherto made by men in the
sciences, ‘Neque illud praetermittendum eet, quod nacta sit philo-
sophia naturalis per omnes aetates adversarium molestum et diffi-
cilem; superstitionem nimirum, et zelum religionis caecum et immo-
deratum) And again: ‘At in hujusmodi misturis theologiae cum
philosophia, ea tantum, quae nune in philosophis recepta sunt, eom·
prehenduntur; sed nova, licet in melius mutata, tantum non summo-
ventur et exterminantur! And he sums up as follows: *At vere rem
reputanti, philosophia naturalis, post verbum Dei, certissima super-
stitionis medicina est; eademque probatissimum fidei alimentum.
Itaque merito religioni donatur tanquam fidissima ancilla: cum altera
voluntatem Dei, altera potestatem manifestet!

Now 1 think that these passages, and the complete separation
which he there advocates between theology and seience, fumish the
best key to Bacon's religious opinions, and, at the same time, afford
an explanation of the almost constant disputes which have been
carried on nearly from his own times to ours as to what the nature of
his religione opinions really was. Itis easy to see that a man who
penned the above sentences might readily be suspected os harbouring
in his mind a still greater mistrust os theologicat conelusions than he
overtly expresses ; and it is, at the same time, I think, no less easy to
see. is we know anything of the history of opinion, that the maxims
expressed might in Bacon's age, when speculatione. of this kind and
the compat-ison of conclusions arrived at in different branehes of
knowledge were comparatively rare, be uttered, even by a man of the
most religious temperament, in perfect good-faith.

1 arn myself of opinion not only that the religious side of these
Aphorisms expresses Bacon's sincere convictione, but also that he did
not materially dissent from the religious teaching on what may be
called the fundamental doctrines os Christianity which was generally
current in his day.

In order to arrive at an independent opinion on this point, t will
ask the rader, who is interested in the question, caresutty to compare
the following references (which are, of course, far too long to be
estracted): Nov. Org. ἰ. 65, 89 i De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S..
