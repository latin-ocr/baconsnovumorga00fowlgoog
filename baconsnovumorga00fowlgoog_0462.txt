Ex iis, quae ante dicta sunt, patet quod quinque ina in-
stantiarum genera de quibus diximus (viz. instantiarum con-
formium, instantiarum monadicarum, instantiarum devian-
tium, instantiarum limitanearmn, :instantiarum potestatis) non
debeant reservari, donec inquiratur natura aliqua certa (quem-
admodum instantiae reliquae, quas primo loco proposuimus,
nec non plurimae ex iis quae sequentur, reservari debent);
sed statim jam ab init'm facienda est earum collectio, tanquam
historia quaedam particularis; eo quod digerant ea quae in-
grediuntur intellectum, et corrigant pravam complexionem
intellectus ipsius, quem omnino necesse est imbui et infici

et demum perverti ac distorqueri ab incursibus quotidianis
et consuetisffl.

Chiromancy, may read in his own hand what his correspondent had set
down in his. For instance, would 1 in London acquaint my intimate
ln Paris, that 1 um null: 1 would then prick that part where 1 had
appointed the letter [l] and, doing so in another place to signifie that
word was done, proceed to [Α] thence to [M] and so on, till 1 had finisht
what l intended to make known!

‘Then there is a Magnetick way of cnrlng wounds by anoinfing the
weapon, and that the wound is affected iu like manner as is the extra-
venate blood by the Sympathetick medicine, as to matter of fact with
circumstances of good evidence azel-ted by the Noble Sir K. Digby lu hb
ingenious discoume on the subject. The reason of this magnale he
attempts by Mechanism, and endeavours to make it out by atomiml
aporrheas, which passing from the cruentae eloth or νεαροῦ to the
wound, and being incorporated with the particlee of the salve car-rr
them ln their embraces to the affected part: where the medicina! ateana
entering together with the effluvlums of the blood, do by their subtle
insinuatlon better effect the cure, than can he done by any &mer ap-
plication. ‘rhe particular way of their eonveyance, and their regular
directiou is handsomely explicated by that learned Knight, and reom-
mended to the ingenious by most witty and hemming illustrationa. tt
is out of my way here to enquire whether the Anima Mundi be unt
a better account than any Mechanical solutions. The somer la more
desperate; the latter perhaps hath more of ingenuity than good ground
of satisfaction. lt is enough for me that de sacto there is such an eu-
tercourse between the Magnetick unguent and the vulnerated body, ud
1 need not be solicitum of tlze eume:
