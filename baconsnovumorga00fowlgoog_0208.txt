11.

Nec manus nuda, nec intellectus sibi permissus. multum
valet; instrumentis et auxiliis re: perficitur3 quibus opus
est, non minus ad intellectum, quam ad manum. Atque ut
instrumenta manus motum aut cient aut regunt3 ita et in-
strumenta mentio intellectui aut suggerunt aut mvent.

ΙΙΙ.

Scientia et potentia humana iri idem coincidunt², quia
ignoratio causae destituit effectum. Natura enim non nisi
parendo vincitur-³: et quod in contemplatione instar causae
est, id in open-atlone instar regulae est.

IV.

Ad opera nil aliud potest homo, quam ut corpora natu-
ralia admoveat et amoveat: reliqua natura intus transigit ⁴.

V.

Solent se immiscere naturae (quoad oper-2⁶) mechanicus,
mathematicue, medicus, alchemista‚ et magus3 sed omnes (ut
nunc sunt res) conatu levi, successu tenui‘.

² The arne thought is osten briefly expressed in English under the
form: ‘Knowledge is Power.' lt may be remarked that Power always
implies Knowledge, but Knowtedge does not always give power. To do
a thing, we must know how to do it, but there are some departments
of knowledge which, however interesting in themselves or valuahle as
instruments of mental dietipline, do not appear to inm-ease our power
over Nature.

Baton seldom lose· any opportunity of insisti-ag on the praetia! np-

⁴ piicatious of scieuce. Professor Pleyi'air truly remarks that the want of

connection between the sciences and ms was one of the principe! defectu
which nacon deplored in the philosophy of his time.

⁵ We must patiently observe Nature, if we wish to acquiro any control
over her operatione. Our ⁵ roien· are merely copies and adaptatione of the
⁸ causes' which we see at work io the exter-nil world. The same sentence.
slightly altered. is repeated ln Aphorism ¹²⁹- See note ou it in that place.

¹ We cannot create3 we ean only combine or separate bodies already
existing. ‘ln Art,' says Playfair, ‘man does nothing more than bring
things nearer to one another, or carry thern farther off3 the rest b
performed by Nature, and on most occasionz by meam of which we
are quite ignorant:

⁶ So far as concerns the active or operative part of knowledge, that is to
say, Art as distinguished from Scienee.

⁸ Mr. Kitchin has the following note: ‘As to the Mechunieiau. the
Mathematician and the Physician, Baeon’s remarks were being rakified tt
