With respect to the first question, 1 mn only state monci! my
own belief that the most characteristic school of Engl'ssh psyfflogisn
und moralius, and, through them, a most imponant school of Eu-
ropesn philosophy, has been profoundly influenoed by the meffiod
and speculationis of Bacon. The main principle of Locke's Esuy,
namely that all our ideas are derived from either sensatico orrefleo-
tion, appears to me to be contained in germ in the nst Aphorism
of the Novum organum, while ιο the attentive render there ean be
no doubt that his whole mode οῖ treating psychologiml questions in
thoroughly imbued with the spirit os Bacon's method- It is true that
Locke does not mention Bacon ⁷, but, as 1 shall point out walter,
the frequent citation of authors’ names was not a sashion of that
time. Though the whole os the Essay might not improperly be
regarded as n polemic against the philosophy ol* Descnrtes, it is only
very seldom that Locke refers to him by name. Agnin, 1 think it
would be very difficult ror any one, aster caresully reading the 7211
Book os the De Augmentis and aster meing the obvious applico.-
tions of Bacon's principles and method to the science of conduct,
to resist the conclusion that his speculations and, perhaps still moro,
his method of investigation are, to a large extent, the source of that
great school ol* moral philosophy which, number-ing men so widely
divergent in many respecto as Hobbes and CumberIsnd, Butler and
hotham, agrees in basing the rules of conduct on an inductiva
examination of the principles os human nature and the consequen-u
of human actions. English philosophy, or, at last, sar the luget
portion of it, seems to me to be tlioroughly Baconian in its ains.
in its spirit. and in its method. In the eyes os mmythis maybo
