Intellectus humanus ex proprietate sua ‘⁷ saeue supponit
majorem ordinem et aequalitatem in rebus, quam invenit:
et cum multa sint in natura monadica ⁵⁸, et plena imparitatis,

tamen affingit paraueia, et correspondentia, et relativa, quae
non sunt ⁶⁹. Hinc commenta illa. in coelestibus omnia muri

Bacon has fallen into this error.

my Inductive Logic, 3rd ed. pp. 324-336. The faneiful appliention of
numbers has elways played a great part in fallacium conceptione of this
character. See a carious article on the number Seven in the efflui
Journal, vol. viii. One of the latest instances or scientific reseas-chet being
influenced by these specularium is afforded in the mse of Huyghens. ‘The
attention which Huyghens: says Professor Playfair (Preliminary nissen-«auom
to the Encyclopcdia Britannica), ‘ had paid to the ring of satum, led him
to the discovery of a satellite of the same planet. His telesoopae were not
powerful enough to discover more of them than one3 be believed, indeed,
that there were no more, and that the number of the planeta now dis·
covered was complete. The reasouing by which be convincet! himself, b
a proof how slowly men are cur-ed of their prejudices, even with the best
talents and the best information. The planets, primm and secundm,
thus made up twehe, the double of six, the first of the perfect numbers.
ln 1671, however, cummi discovered another sutelffle, and nstervards
three more, making five in all, which the more perfect telescopes of
Dr. Herschell have lately augmented to seven.¹

It must be remembeoed, however, that some of the greatest dimoveris
in scienee bave originated in the bold use of Analogy. Thus, the whole
scfence of Biotogy has been revolutionised by following out the mlogies
between vegetable and animal life, between fosi! remeius and living

analogia which bave osten given the first elue to :seez-§afflue une
affinities of lengun-es, are other instances which will occur to almost every
reader-

Coeli (E. and S.. vol. iii. pp. 7⁷⁴-5)· 'At manifestum est, phaetas
