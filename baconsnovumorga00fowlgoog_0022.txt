ssis course, 1 have assumed in my readers a certain amount ol'
acquaintance with the history os philosophical speculation, as well as
with the outlines of logie. But to readers, who do not come to the
study of the book with this amount os acquirement, 1 cannot think
that an edition, worth the putting out, could be of any service.

The arrangement of the Sections has been a matter of some
difficulty, as several of them stand in little relation to those that pre-
cede οι· follow. On the whole, 1 have thought it most convenient,
keeping apart as sar as possible the expository sections from those
which are mainly historical, and bringing together those which stand
in any close connection, to adopt the following order:

ξ 1. Dates os the leading events in Bacon’s Life, and os the first
publication os his principal writings.

ξ 2. The object of the Novum Organum.

ἦ 3. Relation of the Novum Organum to the more important os
Bacon's other philosophical works‚ ”

54. Was the Novum Organum written in Latin?

55. Bacon's general philosophical opinions.

56. Bacon's scientific attainments and opinions, with special
reference to the state of knowledge in his time.

57. Bacon's religious opinions.

§3- The meaning attached by Bacon to the word ‘Form¹ (in-
cluding a note on the ‘ Four Causes' os Aristotle).

ξ 1 ι. The causes of Aristotle's failure in his physical researches.

ξ 12. The reaction against the authority of Aristotle.
