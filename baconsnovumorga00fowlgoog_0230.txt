Doctrina enim de idolis similiter se habet ad interpretationem

Idola tribus sunt fundata in ipsa natura humana, atque in

sensum humanum ¹⁹ esse mensuram rerum: quin contra,

‘¹' That is to my, it is Bac0n¹s Doctrine of Fallacies, and its fimction is
to clear the mind of false notium, in order that it may be open to the
reception οἱ true onae.

⁴⁸ Must we then despair of the possibility of attaining knowledge? We
cannot, indeed, transcend the limitaneus of our own famina, or know
things except in relation to our own bodily and mental constitution but
by comparing our impressionis and inferentes, one with another, and with
those of other men, and, above all. by constantly reviewing and connecting
nur conceptione by compat-ison with the facts of Nature, we are able
to detect not only the individual peculiarities ot' our own min& bnt also
the general teudencies to error which are common to mankind at luge.
The mind, though it is beset with phantoms‚ has not entirely lost the
power of distinguishing between phantoms and realitioe.

⁴⁹ n· this is mennt to represent the dictum of Protagoras, lt doec εο most
inadequately. Protagoras asserted, not that the sense: uncontrolled by
reason, but that man, meaning the human faculae· generally, was the
measure of ali things. ndum-r χρημάτων μέτρον ἅνθρωπος, τῶν μὶ Sur-v ὧς
ἔστι, τᾶν δὲ οὔκ ὄντων ὧς οὐκ ἴσην. Making due aliomnce for the rehssvity
of human knowledge, that is, understanding the maxim in the form,
‘Man is to man the measure oi all things: it seems to be not only true but
a truism. And the same may be said of the individuali form which the
maxim sometimes takes: ‘Every man is to himself the measure οἱ all
things! ln the Theaetetus, however, where the Protagoran dictum is
discussed, the theory that cognition is simply sensible Pan-ceptior· ts dis-
cussed also, the two enquiries being confounded. and treated as identical.
Thut Protagoras never expressly asserted the latter propodtion is annuet
certain. ¹ lt is not improbable: says Mr. Grote, ‘that the three doctrines·
(namely, that man is the measure of all things, that Cognition is sensible
Perception, and that Nature consists in a perpetual motion, change, or
nux), ‘here put together by Plato and subjected to a common scrutioy,
may have been sometimes held hythe same philosophas. Nemi-elesa,
the language of Plato himself shem us that Protagoras never expreaely
affirmed knowledge to be sensible Perceptlon: and that the substantia!
identity between this doctrine, and the different doctrine maintained by
Protagora, is to be regarded as a construction put upon the two by Plato:
The student has already, in a previous note, been referred to ΜΓ. Grote⁸s
admirable criticism of the Theaetetus, where the Pmtagm-ean dietm, in
its vai-inus relations, is dismissed at great length and with much acute-neas.
