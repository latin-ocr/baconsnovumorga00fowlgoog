In his letter to Father Fulgenfio, which Mr. Spedding resen to
16a5²‚ Bacon says: ‘Equidem memini me, quadraginta abhinc aunis,
juvenile opusculum eirca has res confecisse. quod magna pronus
fiducia et magnifico titulo “Temporis partum Maximum ¹³ inscripsL'
This would shew that, at or about the early age of twenty-five, Baton
had already begun to contemplate the Renovation of Science. But
the first form in which this idea occurred to him seems to have been
to write a great work on the Interpretation os Nature, that is, on the
new method os Induction¹. Of this, we have some frag-ments in
Valerius Terminus, the wboie or the greater part of which seems to
have been written about 1603 or ¹604’- It is needless to edd
that Bacon's idea was afterwards far more fully carried out, in
part at least, by the Novum Organum. Of the much more ex⁴
tended scheme of the Great Instauration in six parts, we have the
first intimation¹ in the Partis Instaurationis Secundae Delineatio et
Argumentum, which Mr. Spedding thinks ‘may be referred with toler·
able confidence to the year 1606 or ¹⁶07 *ζ’ and certainly to some
time prior to the composition os the Cogitata et Visa, which. in its
first form, seems to have been composed in the summer or autumn
of 1607 ¹. Both these works are interesting as covering much of
the same ground as the Novum Organum, and may profitably be
compared with it and with one another.

of the Great Instauration, no part, as Mr. Ellis truly says, cm be
regarded as absolutely complete, though the first part, the Parti-
tiones Scientiarum, pointing out what had been done and what
remained to be done in the various scientum, is more adequately
represented thau any other. This is contained in the De Augmentis,
published in 1623 (about three years aster the publication of the
