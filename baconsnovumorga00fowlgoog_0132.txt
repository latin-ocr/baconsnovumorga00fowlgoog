112 INTRODUCYION.

He then describes how he chased away Authority,

*Nor suffex-'d Living men to be misled

how he broke the ‘ Scar-crow Deitie ³ of the orchard, how he brought
the mind srom words to things, Sec.

‘From these and all long Ermrs of the way,
In which our wandring Praedeoessors went.
And like th' old Hebrews many years did stmy
In Desarts but of small extent,
Baeon, like Moses. led us forth at last.
The barren Wilderness he past,
Did on the very Border stand
Of the blest promis'd Laud.

Saw it himself. and shew'd us it!

It should be noticed that Sprat¹s book received the sanction of the
Royal Society‚ and that copies os it were sent by them to foreign
princes and other eminent persons on the continent. Hence Liebig's
sneer at Sprat (Allgemeine Zestung, March 7, 1864), unless he is
prepared to extend it generally to the members of the Royal Society
at that time, is entirely out of place.

But there is much more evidence to the same effect. The cele-
brated mathematician, Dr. Wallis, in the very interesting Account
os some Passages os his own Life, published in Appendix, Num. xi, to
Hearne’s Presace to Peter Langtoft¹s Chronicle¹⁹, says: ‘About the
year 1645, while Ι lived in London, '³ ⁸ * * ⁸ I had the opportunity
of being acquainted with divers worthy Persons, inquisitive into
Natural Philosophy, and other parts of Humane Leaming5 and
particularly of what hath been called the New Philosophy or Ex-
perimental Philosophy! He then proceeds to give the names of his
associates and their places os meeting. ‘Our business was to Discourse
and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related there-
unto! * * * * * ‘Some os which were then but New discoveries,
and others not so generally known and imbraced, as now they are,
with other things appertaining to what bath been called The New
Philosophy ; which from the times os Galileo at Florence, and Sir
Francis Bacon (Lord Verulam) in England, hath been much culti-
vated in Italy, France, Germany, and other parts abroad‚ as well as
with us in England.'
