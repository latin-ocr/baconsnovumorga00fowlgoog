INTRODUCTION.

i *This list, for which 1 am entirely indebted ιο Mc. Effls’s precam·
>¹ md notes. might probably be increased; but the instanoes emmer-ned
are sufficient to sliew not only that Bucen* was ill read in the history
of these branches of learning. (and yet it was in thie directim
that seleuce was making the most real and mpid mitaneas) but
aleo that upon such subjecte his ideas were not clean-3 this latter
defeci being no doubt the cause of the othei-5 sor where he cmtld not

readily follow the steps of the invesfigafion, he could hardly appi-echte
tbe velue of the result.⁵

To this list, formidabte as it is. might be added a number os
beliefs in which Bacon was certainly not superior to the current
opinions os his time. Thus, he is evidently a believer. not onlyin
Natural but Judicial Astrology, though, it must be owned, with ι
certain amount of hesitation and discrimination. See the long
and remarkable passage in De Augmenfis, lib. iii. cap. 4 (Ε. und S„
vol. i. pp. 554-56o>. After beginning with the very true remark, ‘At
Astrologia multa superstitione referta est, ut vix aliquid sanum in ea
reperiatur‚’ and rejecting various branches os the pretended scierim,
he, nevertheless, allows that the study ol· the stat-s may enable ns to
predict not only natural events, like floods, frosts, droughts, earth-
quakes, stc„ but ⁴ wara, sedidena, schisma, transmigratione of peoples,
and, in short. all commotioris or great revolutions ot* things, natural
as well as civil! *Neque Electiones prorsus rejiciendae sum,- sed
parcius illis quam Praedictionibus fidendum. Videmus enim in planta-
tionibus et seminationibus et insitionibus, aetatum lunae observationes
non esse res omnino frivolas ¹⁵⁴!

To the curicus and about-d speculations on ‘spiriff which abeund
in the Novum Organum and elsewhere. and many of which seem to
have been derived from Paracelsus‚ 1 shall frequently have occasion
to call attention in the notes. A typiml passage may be found in
Novum Organum, ii. 40.

Though Patricius had already, in the most seornful lnngmge,
attacked the Peripatetic doctrine os the transmutability οῖ the elementa,
Bacon evidently believed that air and water, under certain conditione,
were mutually convertible. Thus in the Novum Orgmmmfii. 48 (ι 1),

⁸⁸ Cp. Nov. Org- ii. 50 (6) (ὅ), ’ Neque omittendi sunt ωηιωςιις inter motu et
affectus tunae, et passiones corporum interiorum, proutex experimentis agriculturae,
mutinae. et malicia-e, aut alias, cum delectu severo et sincero colligi et :enipi
possint:
