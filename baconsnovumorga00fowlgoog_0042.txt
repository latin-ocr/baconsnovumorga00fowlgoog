22 INTRODUCTION.

eundemque Deum fuisse, qui creaturis leges illas Naturae, hominibus
vero legem Christianam dedisset ”J

tt is a remark very characteristic of Bacon's point of view that the
superiority of the public to the private good determines the contro-
versy as to the relative advantages of the practical and contemplative
lise in favour of the former. For the reasons, he says, adduced by
Aristotle in favour of the latter have respect only to private good
and the pleasure or dignity os the individual. Nor, if the monastic
life had been regarded as merely and strictly contemplative, could any
doubt on this question have ever an'sen in the church: ‘Contempla-
tivam vero quod attinet meram, et in seipsa terminatam, quaeque
radios nullos sive caloris sive luminis in societatem humanam diffundat;
nescit eam certe Theologia⁴⁰.'

ln concluding this semion, 1 must again remind the reader that
Bacon's merit (locs not consist in his philosophical teaching in the
proper sense os the term, but in his asser-tion of the necessity of a
new method, osa new range of studies, of a new spirit of enquiry,
Ile was a logician, in the widest and sullest sense of the word.
A philosopher lie did not claim to be; and though 1 believe that
his works exerted a very powersul influence on the philosophieal
speculations os the two succeeding centuries, a philosopher, in the
strict sense os the term, he was not.

Of the many charges brought against Bacon, as a philosopher
and a reformet of science, there are three, connected with the present
subject, which it would be vain to deny, though, in the course of
this enquiry, we may find something to plead in extenuation of them.
The first is that he was a Dilettante in science. The second, that
he was imperfectly acquainted with the existing state of knowledge.
The third, that he grossly exaggerated the desects ol' his own time,
which, in spite of all that he says, was really one of great and
fruitsul intellectual activity.
