At longe maximum impedimentum et aberratio intellectus
humani provenit a. stupore et incompetentia et fallatiis
sensuum ⁸²; ut ea, quae sensum feriunt, illis, quae sensum
immediate non feriunt, licet potioribus, praeponderent. Itaque
contemplatio sere desinit cum aspectu; adeo ut rerum in·
visibilium exigua aut nulla sit observatio. Itaque omnis
operatio spirituumffl in corporibus tangibiiibus inclusorum

'¹ It is, perhaps. almost superfluous to remark that, since Ba'con's time,
the ⁴:1¹1an incompetenter, and deceptions' οξ the senses have been, to
a great extent, remedied by the discovery of new instrumente„ by methodo
of corrections, and by a more careful discrimination between our misina!
perceptions and the subsequent operatione oi* the intellect upon them.

⁸⁸ This idea of ⁴ spirits ' shut up in bodies, inanimae as well as mhnate,
is of frequent occurrence in the end Book. See, sor instance, the 7th and
40th Aphorisms, where some of the statements and speculationis arc very
curious. Immediately horrowed, perhaps, from Paraceisus, or taken gene·
rauy from the physical philosophy of the day, this doctrine seems to
have had a peculiar atu-action for Bacon. ‘The idea,¹ says ΜΓ. Ellis
(Prefaee to the Historia Vitae et Mortis, E. and 8., vol. ii. p. 94), ‘on
which Bacon's theory of longevity is founded, namely, that the principle of
life resides in a subtle fluid or spirit which penneatee the tangible parts of
the organisation of planis and animals, seems to be coeval with the first
origin οἱ speculative physiology. Bacon was one of those by whom this
idea was emended from organised to inorganic bodies: in all substanoea,
according to him, residue a portion of spirit which mnffoets itself only in
its operations, being altogether intangible and without weight. This
doctrine appeared to him to be of most certain truth, but he hu nowhere
stated the grounds of his comicum, nor even indicated the kind of
evidence by which the existence of the spiritus is to be atahlished. ln
living bodies he conceived that two kinds of spirits exist: a unde οι·
mortuary spirit, such as is present in other substantes: and the animal
or vital spirit, to which the phenomena ol life are to be referred. To
keep this vital spirit, the wine oi lise, from oozing away, ought to be the
aim of the physician who attempts to increase the number of our few and
evil days!

This physica]⁸ or rather metaphysical, theory of a saule, invisible, and
intangible auid or ether, permeating every material substance, whether
animate or inanimata, as well as the langua'ge in which we even still speak
of 'spirits of wine,' and the like, may be regarded as curione murrinis
of a primitive. fetichistie era, when men litei-any believed that every olziect
amand them was animated or possessed by a soui or ‘spirit ' similar to their
own, and that this soul or spirit was itseif a material, though it might be m
invisible, substance. The student will find some most interesting and
mggestive remarks on this subject in Mr. Tylor's Primitive Cultu-e, vol. li.
