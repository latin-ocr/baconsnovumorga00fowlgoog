The suggatiuns and contributione made by Bncon to the odonna

to these 1 have drawn attention in two other sections, thot on hi·
general philosophical opinions and that ou hie influeuce on Philosophy
and Science.

1 have reserved to the last some remarks on the invesugatlon into
the nature os Heat. which occupies so conspicuous a place in the
Novum organum. It is quite true, ns Mr. Ellis points out in ln·-
Gcneral Prel'ace ¹⁸, that the provisional conclusion adopted by Bocon
in ii. πο, as his vindemiatio Prima. is not the result os the Method ol
Exclusion, but rests immediately upon the three tables of Compos-enfin.
Hence it does not pretend to be the result os fonnal proof, but only a
sort of probable hypothesis based upon the consideration mocon-
parisoo of a large number of instance& Sepamting. however, the
question οἱ the mode by which it was arrived at from the nature md
value of the conclusion itself, I think Bacon must bc credited with
having in a remarkable manner anticipated one of the most beautiful
and important discoveries ol' modern seleuce. stripping it of certain
excrescences, the essential part of theconclusion is that Heu is an
expansive motion amougst the minute particlcs os bodies. And thia,
after much speculation and experimentation‚ and the pretiorum,
for a long time, of another theory, namely, that licat is a subue auid,
called Calor-ic. is the precise conclusion at which the most eminent
physicists have at length arrived. Professor Tyndall does Baoou tho
