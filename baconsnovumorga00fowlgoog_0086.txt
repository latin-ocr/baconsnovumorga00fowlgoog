difficult questions which presente itsell' in the oourte οῖ hum
speculationi.

It is nn entirely distinet question whether Bacon acted rightly in
expelling the consideration of Final Censes so completely as he pro-
posed to do from the domain oi* Physica, and it is certainly emtione
oommenuiry on his procedure that, at the very time when he was
composing the Novum organum, Harvey was employing this very
mode ol' reesoning in the famous remrches which resulted in the
discovery of the Circulation of the Blood ³⁴. Nor would any one, 1
presume, now deny that the idea of sanction, which implies eo much
of the idea os Final Cattae ns is included in the word adaptatam
as distinct from ἀπὲκ, is a conception absolutely eseentinl to the
successful prosecution os at least one scimee, that of physiology.
And, even in the higher sciences of psychology, ethice, and potitius,
there are few enquirers who can avoid from time to time asking the
question, what purpose does such and such a constituent subserve in
the mental, moral, or social economy. In chemistry, mineralogy,
and those branches ol* science to which the word ‘physice' is osten
restricted, such enquiries are much rarer, but 1 question whether there
is any single sciente, other than mathematical, from which the idea of
adaptatiou can be strictly and consistently excluded. How we are to
interpret the fact of adaptation is a different question, aud one which
by the great mass of scientific enqulrers would now be answered in a
very different fanhion from what ever occurred to any hut a few
isolated thinkers in previous generations. The limite of this Intro—
duction being necessarily restricted, it is enough here simply tn nllude
to the theory ol'Evolution, and to works such as those of Mr. Danda,
Mr. wallace, and Mr. Herbert Spenoer. To prevent, however, any
misconcepzion οῖ my own opinions, 1 cannot refrain from repeating
here what 1 have already said in another place, that the main drist of
the arguments employed in Natural Theology is not affected by the
modern theory of Evolution. 1r 1 may be allowed to quote mysett,
‘1 nm far from denying that the Argument from Final Causa, if it
take sufficient account os the evolution of organisms and their power
os adapting themselves to external circumstances, and if itbe based
on the contemplation of Nature as a whole, instead of on that of indi-

* Hnrvey began publicly to tent-,h this doctrine in 1619. though his work on the
subiect wa not pubiished till 1628. His discovery set out from obserring the
