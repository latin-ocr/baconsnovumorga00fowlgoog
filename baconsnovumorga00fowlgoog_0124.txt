Jecn Baptiste Du Hamei, the weil-known author oi* the Phssoeophh
Vetus et Nova, and the first Secretary of the Academy os Sciences. itt
his work De Mente Humana, published in 1⁶7²· gim a long nccount
of the Buconian method (lib. iii. capp, 7—9)‚ and. in speaking of
hducfion, says: “Verulamius primus hoe argumentum tractavit uber-
rime,⁸ ‘Hoc argumentationis genus ιι Verulamio motatum uberrime
et ab aliis sere neglectum? 1t is plain, therefore, that he regarded
nacon as virtiially the author of the Inductive or Experimental
Meihod.

in the shape of a separate article, of either Galileo or Deecartes. But
the mecgreness ol· his account is nn proni* os disparagement. For he
calls Baoon ‘un da plus grans Espriis de son siecle, et i'un de ceux
qui connurent le plus doctement i'imperfection οὺ έῐοὶῐ laPhiiosophie.'
He adds: ¹ 11 travallia sommant aux moieno d'y remedier, et il forma

This evidence (which, 1 believe, might be greatly extendedss) ie
sufficient to shew that Bacon¹s name vae, at this period, weil known
in france, and that his merite were recognized by some of the sore-
most meri in philosophy and science. So inanem-ate is the statement
of Montuela ¹⁸, accepted by Dugnld stem, and since stequendy
repeated, that the celebrity os Bacon's writings in ance hardly daie·
beck beyond ihe appearance of the Encyclopedie.

It iz unquestionable‚ however, that the petronage os Voltaire and
the Encyclopedisoe did much to extend the study of Bacon's writinga
besides producing a considerable controversy as to his true meaning
on many questions of philosophy and theology (see section on the
Bibliogrnphy os the Novum Organum). Voltaire devoted to Bucon the
