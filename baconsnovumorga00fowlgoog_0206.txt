SUMMARY OF BOOK Ι.

THE First Book of the Novum organum, which was designed to be a
sort of introduction to the whole work, is called in the Part'ss Secundae
Delineatio (Ellis and Spedding, vol. iii. p. ⁵5²) ‘pars praeparans,' in
opposition ὶο the ‘pars infonnans,‘ which was to be compi-ised in the
remaining books. The following brief account of its contents may be
of service to the reader. Aphs. 1-31 consist of certain preliminary remarks,
chiefly on the futility of the methods of enquiry at present in use and
the necessity of a more faithful study of Nature. In Aphs. 32-37‚ he
makes a kind of apology for the introduction of a new method. Aphs.
38-70 contain the doctrine of the Idola, to which Bacon justly attaches
the utmost importance. ‘ Primo enim mentis area aequanda, et liberanda
ab eis quae hactenus recepta sunt.’ (Partis Secundae Delineatio, Ellis
and Spedding, vol. iii. p. 548.) Ther· follow the signs, five iu number, of
the weakness and inutility of preceding philosophi& (Aphs. 71-77). These
are followed by the causes, fifteen in number, of so long continuance
in error (Aphs. 78-92). In the middle of Aphorism 9², he passa on
- to the Grounds of. Hope in the future progress of Scieuce. These are
twenty-one, and occupy Aphs. 9²-1 1 5. The next three Aphorisms contain
three cautious or warnings. Aphs. ι 19-121 contain three apologies. 'rhen
follow the answers to four possible objections (Aphs. 122-126). The next
Aphorism is of great importance, as vindicating for the application of his
method not only the field of natural, but also that of moral and mental
science. The remainder of the Book (Aphs. 128-130) consists of certain
miscellaneous remarks, forming the transition to Book ii.
