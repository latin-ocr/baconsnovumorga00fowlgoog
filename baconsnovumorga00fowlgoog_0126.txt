In the Histoire Modeme (which, however, appeared after the puhiim- ‚
tion of the Encynlopfflie), besides passing a high eulogium on anonf
he gives a brier summary of a portion os the Firet Book of the Novum
Organum See livre xx. ch. η. 1t may be worth noticing that
Condiuac's objections to Bacon's threesold division of the sciencae
are peculiarly acute and effective.

In 1751 appeared the Encyclopedie. This work not only contained
ι Ηυῑεήηε article on ‘ Βαιτῡῐιιίςιιιε,Ι but, in the Disconrs Preliminaire
by D'Alembert, he is styled ¹ le plus grand, le plus univer-sel, et le plus
eloquent des Philosophes: The exaggerated ione here adopted (aa,
for instance, ‘Baeon ne dans le sein de la nuit la plus profunde. sentit
que la Philosophie n’etoit pas encore ¹), as well as the fact that the
Encyclopedists claimed Eacon as one of themselves, not unnaturally
gave rise to a violent reaction against him, such as we witness in the
work οἱ De Maistre.

It is unnecessary to pureue any further the subject os Baoon'e
reputation and influence in che, and we now turn to Italy.

That Bacon's works were well known and esteemed in Italy, even
during his lifetime, is plain from the following passage in the Life os
Bacon prefixed by Rawley to his Resuscitatio, published in 1657}

'His same is greater and sonnds louder in foreign pam abmd,
than at home in his own natium thereby verifying that divine

and t'n lu's own house. *Concerning which 1 will give you a mete only,
out of a letter written from Italy (the storehouse of refined vits)
to the late Earl of Devonshire, then the Lord Candish: I will expect

have been anciently and yet Iately translated into other tongues, both
learned and modern, by foreign pens!
