ut ultimo loco perveniatur ad maxime generalia3 quae via

vera est, sed intentata. XX

Eandem ingreditur viam (priorem scilicet) intellectus sibi
permissus, quam facit ex ordine dialecticaeffi. Gestit enim
mens exsilire ad magis generalia, ut acquiescam et post par-
vam moram fastidit experientiam: sed haec mala demum
aucta sunt a dialectica ob pompas disputationum.

Intellectus sibi permissus, in ingenio sobrio et patiente et
gravi (praesertim si a doctrinis receptis non impediatur),
tentat nonnihil illam alteram viam, quae recta est, sed exiguo
prosectu: cum intellectus, nisi regatur et juvetur, res inae-
qualis ²⁴ sit, et omnino inhabilis ad superandam rerum obscuri-
tatem.

to supply them with sound arguments for it3 nor, even in the time of
Copernicus himself, was it mure than the simplest and must consistent
explanation of known facts.

The student is speclally recommended to read Mr. Mlll’s strictum on
this Aphorism. See Mill's Logic, bk. vi. ch. 5. § ⁵· On the other side, he
may refer to Dr. Whewell's Philosophy ot* Discovery, ch. xxii. § 36-62.

ln extenuation of Bacon’z error, sor such l conceive it to be, may
be plended the exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory character of the
‘axiomata maxime generalia “ which were in vogue in his time. As μου(
of this, 1 may cite the list which Mr. Mill himself give· at the &siunins
of the 24st1 chapter of his Examination of Sir W. Hamilton's Philosophy.

Notwithstauding all that is said here and in other places, nacon himself
has recourse to hypothesis (under the name of ‘permissio intellectus ’) in
11. ιο. The view which he there takes of its relation to Induction is far mooe
just than that here taken. See my note on the beginning of that Aphorism.

'³³ The mind is naturally prone to the false metha-xl, and is encournged in
its tendencies by the use of the vulgar logie, which fail: to insist on the
examination ot first principles. This proneneffl of the mind to rest in
first principles, however obtained, and ιο resent any examinat-ion of them,
is due mainly tn n combination of pride with mental indolence. We recoil
from the trouble of reviewing what lies at the bottom of so many of our
beiiess, and we are too prond to ncknowledge that we have been so long m·
so frequently in error. To a certain extent, also, it may be acconnted for
by the principle of associatiou. We have ourseives repeated, or heard the
maxim repeated by ethes, so frequently, and in connection with ιο many
other propositionis which we accept as true, that we can hardly conceive it
being called ln question.
