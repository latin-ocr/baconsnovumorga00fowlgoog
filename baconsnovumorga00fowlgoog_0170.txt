Entwleklungsgesehichte der Erfahmngephiloeophie. Leipzig, 1875.
[This work is of great importance in ὼε etudy of the Boeoti-n
philosophy, and of peculim interest aa containing so favoni-able an
estimate of Baetin from a foreign writer, belonging himself to ι very
different school of thought]

Ueber Baco's von Vemlarn wissenschaftliche Principien von A.
Lasson. Berlin, 1860. [This short met is, to my mind, the most
effective os all the attacks ou the Baconian philosophy. 1t must,
1 think, have suggested to Liebig the onslaught which he made time
years subsequently, but it is far mone moderate and elevated in tone
then is his dieti-ibe, and shews a sar more intimate acquaintance both
with Bacon’s doctrines and with the history ol' philosophy in
general]

sorsehung. von Justue von Liebig. hlfinchem 1863. [This disquisition
is written in a tone ol' shrill invective, almost as if Bacon were ι.
persona! enemy of the writer. Liebig was himself so well satisfiet!
with his performance, that he published it also in an English surm,
in Macmillan's Magazine (July and August, 1863). lt hu been
translated into French, aad published with some notes and addi-
tions. by M. De chihatchel', Paris, 186⁶ (ΞΜ Ed.. 1877).]

A large part of Franchi’s Letture su la storia deun Filosofla
Moderna, Milano, 1863. is devoted to Baeon. [The estimem of him
as a reformet of method and seleuce is, on the whole, nnl'avournble]
