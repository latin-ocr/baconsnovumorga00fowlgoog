In constituendo autem axiomate, forma inductionis alia
quam adhuc in usu fuit excogitanda est; eaque non ad
principia tanturn (quae vocant) probanda et invenienda, sed
etiam ad axiomata minora et media, denique omnia. Inductio

bined with a keen perception of the requirements of evidence and with
corresponding critical acumen. Baton has really hit the mark in Apu. 57.

’¹ On the Inductio per Enumerationem Simplicern, and the distinction
between it and Scientific Indue-tion &quae ad inventionem et demonstra-
tionem scientiarum et artium est utilis'), see my lnductive Logic, 3rd cd„
lma-9, ιιι-ιη, 214-22 r, 274-293. in reading these pas-ges. the student
must distinguish between the legitimae and illegitimate, as well ns between
the necemry and unnecessary, employment ot* the Inductio per Eumen-
tionem simplicem.

’⁸ That is, on no certain grounds.

θ’ Α single contradictor-y instance is generally sufficient to overthrow ω
inductlon based on simple enumeration, but, where an inductioni is hmd on
elimination and seems to establish a camai connection. the strong pre·>
sumption is that any exception is apparent only and is really due to some
muntem-ung cause. Cp. Cogitata et Visa (E. and S„ vol. ill. p.61⁸):
'Visum est ei, talem inductionis sormam inveniendam, quae ex aliquam
generaliter com-ludim itn ut instantiam contradictoriam inveniri non pone
demonstretur:

'¹¹ Thus, a man living in one part of the globe might infer from the men
whom he had seen that ull men are white, a man living in another part tint
al! men are black, and so on.

¹⁵ This is Scientilic Induction, as distlngulshed fmm Inductio per Enu-
mentionem simplicem. But, though Bacon had formed the idea of n
Scientific lnduction, nr ι proce& of elimination by means of which carues
might be detected, his own account of the proces and ot* the rulee hy
which it should be conducted is vagno and not sufficimur adaptet! to
paetico. Subsequent writers, especially Sir John Her-schel, Dr. Whmu,
and Mr. Mill, have rendered these rules at once more precise and benet
adapted to practice. See notes on Bk. ii. Apis. 11-18‚ and Introduction,
