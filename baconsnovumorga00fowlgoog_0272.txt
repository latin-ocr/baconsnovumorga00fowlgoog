tur ⁰¹¹. Secundo, notiones ab impressionibus sensuum male
abstrahuntur, et interminatae et confusae sunt, quas ter-
minatas et bene finitas esse oportuit. Tertio, inductio mala
est, quae per enumerationem simplicem principia concludit
scientiarum, non adhibitis exclusionibus et solutionibus, sive
separationibus naturae debitis ¹⁸. Postremo, modus me in-
veniendi et probandi, ut primo principia maxime generalia
constituantur, deinde media axiomata ad ea applicentur et
probentur, errorum mater est, et scientiarum omnium m-
lamitas ⁸⁹. Verum de istis, quae jam obiter perstringimus,

(3) We employ the vicious method of Inductio per Enumentionem
simplicem

(⁴) We fiy off at once to the principia maxime generalia, instead
of asceuding to them gradually through the axiomata infima and medi&

⁰⁴¹ Bacon might have added that the substitutions are to be supplied
mainly hy instrumente, the rectiiicntlom mainly by methods.

'⁵ ln opposition to the ordinary method os Inductio p'er nnuman-ationem
simplicem, nacon proposes a method of elimination. it is not, however,
quite clear what is the precise character of the method which he hasln view.
We may take his words either in a general sense οι· with special reference ιο
the methods described iu Book ll. lu the former case. the passagemightbe
paraphrased ns follows: ‘We ought to ezclude all instanceswhich do not thmw
light on the object of enquiry, resolve complex into more simple casa, and
isolate pheuomm so ns to simplify nur investigationis! According to
the latter alternative, he has in mind the process described iu Bk. ii. Apin.
ιε, ¹⁹· The true method of induction, Bacon appears to have thought,
was to draw up tables οἱ presence, absence, ἃς.. and theu, by meana ο(
these, to reject out of all the pofflible explanatione causes, or form of the
phenornenon, first one, and theu another, thus leaving a residuum of expia-
nationz, or possitne causes, out of which the true one was to be found.
If one only mmained, this would be the true explanation, cause, or ⁴ fotum·
⁰ forma affirmativa, solida, et vera, et bene terminata· (ii. ιδ). if nwre
thau one remained, the ‘exclusiva' might he perfeeted by mnus of the
‘praerogativae instantiarum ⁹ and other 'aids of the under-standing· (sec
ii. az). tili¹ at last, the search was narn-owed down to some one ¹ form·
which would be the form required, οι· to a small number amougst which
the true form, cause, or explanation would have to be :ought in ull fut-ure
investigations. For funher information on Bacon's ‘ Methodof andanem:
