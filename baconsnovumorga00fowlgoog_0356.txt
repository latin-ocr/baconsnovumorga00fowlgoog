SUMMARY OF BOOK ΙΙ.

Fnou the prefatory remarks of Book 1, Bacon passer. in Book 11 to a
more formal and positive exposition of his method. The first ten Aphor-
isms consist mainly of general reflections‚ for the most part very obscurely
worded, on the ends of science, on the necessity of enquiring into Forms, and
on the connection between the speculative and practica! branches os know-
ledge. He then proceeds to give a specimen of the investigation of a Form‚
taking as his example the Form of Heat. The first step in the investi-
gation is to draw up certain Tables, the ultimate purpose of which is
to enable him to eliminate those qualities which might be supposed to
be, but which are not really, of the required F orm. When the Tables
are completed, and the false explanations have, so far as possible, been
rejected, he proceeds, according to his own metaphm, to reap the ‘Vin-
demiatio Prima de forma Calidi,⁹ and, in order to reap this vintage, he
gives free play to the lmagination, that is, in spite of his warnings to
the contrary in Book 1, he frames Hypotheses. This process is called
‘permissio intellectus! ‘Atque haec sit prima vindemiatio, sive inter-
pretatio inchoata de forma Calidi, facta per permissionem intellectus'
(see Aph. πο). In Aph. αι he announces that, having completed the
‘Tabulae’ and ‘vindemiatio Prima: he will proceed ‘ad reliqua auxilia
intellectus circa interpretationem Naturae et Inductionem veram ac per-
sectam! Of these ‘auxilia' he enumerates niue (Aph. τι), but of the
nine one only, the ‘Praerogativae instantiarum' (of which there are
twenty-seven varieties)‚ are discussed in the Fragment of the Novum
Organum which Bacon published. He is on the point of passIng on to
the ‘adminicula inductionis: when the work abruptly endS.
