magnis habentur, minoris fecisse. Sed interim (quod jam
diximus) nou at spes nisi in regeneratione scientiarum: ut

arbitramur) affirmaverit.

Ὺ· This, the sixtli, is one of the most important of the ‘Grounds of
Hope: 1t is taken from the future construction of a Natural Hbtory,
speeiauy adapted to the ’σπι-ηρ. ot' Natura! Philosophy (‘collecta nd in·
fumandum intellectum iu ordine ad condendam philosophiam ⁹), :nd
containing a record of experimenta as well ms observations. This ⁴ Natural
Histoi-r was to be supplied* in the third part of the Instaumuo Magna,
which was to be entitled ‘Phae-nomena Universi, sive Historia Naturalis
et Expedmentalis ad condendam Philosophiam! 'romnis constructus:
this third part of the instauratio several attempts were made by nacon,
as in the Historia Ventorum, Historia Vitae et Mortis, Historia Dend
et Rari, Sylva sylvarum, ἃς, These works are collected in the third
volume of Ellis and Spedding¹s Edition, pp. 1-680. lt must be confessori,

conception of a natural history as deliueated in this Aphorism. Ρη the
most successful, perhaps the only successful, part οἱ Lieblg's attackon
Bacon ts directed against this class οἱ his writings.

On the supreme importante which Bacon attached to the collection of
observations and experiments which it was his intention to make, see
Mr. Spedding' s Preface to the Parasceue, given in voL ι. os the Conected
Works, pp. 369-390. 1 cannot, however, hut think that Mr.Spedding
slightly exaggerates the irnportance which Bacon attached to this port οἱ
his reform. surely ‘the novelty, from which the most important results
were to be expected: ir we are to select any oue part of the scheme us
such, was his lnductlve Method. ‘Spes est una iu inductione vera! ¹ ln

1t may he remarked, however. as ι proof of the great impos-unce which
Bncou attached to his Natural Histoi-y, that, when he published the Novum
organum in its frngrnentary ἔοι-ττι, passing over all the ² auxilia intellectus·
(see lib. ii. Aph. αι) between the first and eighth, he thought lt denir-able
to append an account of the latter, as fumishing a description of the plan
on which his Natural Histoi-y was to be constructed. The tltie of thiu
