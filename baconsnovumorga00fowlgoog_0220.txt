Mt. Speddiug notice! that, in his English writingn, Baoon seems to me
the word ‘ original ⁹ ns equivalent to ¹ naturae notior!

It is interesting to compare with thie Aphas-ism the following punge

of the Distributio Operis: ‘At secundum nos, axiomata continente! et
gradatim excitantur, ut nonnisi postremo loco nd generalissima venatus-2
ea vero generalissima evadunt non nationalia, sed‚bene terminata, et tant
quae natum nt revera sibl notiora agnoscat, quaeque rebus lunxe-nt ln
medullis:
” ¹¹ εἶδωλη, ¹ phantoms ' or ¹ specu-es: not ⁸ idols' in the sense oi fahe gods,
ns several writers have iuterpreted it. in the De mamantis, lib. v. mp- 4,
they are called Imagines sive idola, and in the second of the Two Book:
'on the Advancement of Lem-nius, published in 1605, they are spoken d
as ‘salse appeamncee that nro imposed upon ns' by ‘the general natm
of the mind,' by ‘vm-ds: etc. For the latter mage, aee Ellis and
Spedding's Edition of Bacon's Works, vol. iii. pp. 390-7· Mt. Halm
(Lites-amre of Europe, part lii. ch. 3. §6o) gives some amusing enm
from the authors who have mistaken the meaning of the word.

⁵¹ Are these ‘ideas of the divine mind· the ‘sonus’ of which Bnoon
will spealt hereaster? 'rhat God mted all things in conformity with
certain ideas. famus, ox· exemplar-s in his own mind, as the sculptor fannion
nmmo, and that thus, in a cen-enin sense, the world had ι pre-existam
in the mind oi God, is a commonplace of philosophy and theolossy. Cp.
campanella, Metaphysica, pers ἰ. lib. i. Prooemium: ‘Propterea 11ss ent
in mundo, quod non ailquid in mente Dei latens idealiter exn-nnat:
One, though probably not the true, interpretation of the Ideal doctrine
of Plato is that the ἴδω. are simply the iden or typica! foi-nn “istinc

ny the concluding words of the Aphor'ssm, Baoon probably intends in
intimate, as ΜΓ. Kitehln says, ¹ that it would be futile for Man to en·
deavour to contemplate any thing abstncted from, and out of ΙΙ·
connection with, the material world? that, in fact, our only mode of
ascertainiug the ideas os the divine mind is the patient nndy d· the
Book of Nature. The Aphorism might be pan-aphnsed thus: God b
omnineient3 Nature is the reflection os the mind oi* God. Mn, led

ean atttin to knowledge, without going to Nature and thuein senariae
the image of the divine mind. Cp. Aph. ιη.
