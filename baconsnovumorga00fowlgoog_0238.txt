discovery of those singular and subue lawe of electricity which have been
gethered from the ‘remote and heterogeneoiis inmces' which cmild have
occurred only to the patient student of nature.

This Aphorism touches on a number of philosophica! difficulties which it
would he impossible within the limits of a work like this to discus fully οι·
satisfactorily. 1 shan confine myself to a brief statement of my own
opinions and to such references as 1 think likely to be of real use to the
student.

Π The mind is unable to think of the totnlity of space a} finileg for, ot
whatever point we mentnlly place ourselves, we cannot but think of some
point beyond it. Moreover, if space be finite, it mint be bounded hy eone
figure, that is to say, the totality of space must, on this mpposition, have
some shnpe or athen but, whether we regan-d it as spherieal, cublml, or
of any other sbape. there must be some space beyond it in relation to
which it 's said to be of this or that shape, and in which lt Β contained.
Hence, the proposition that Space (in its totality) is finite or bounded.
involves a contradiction iu terum for bounded space must heve some
space beyond it. But, though we are thus compelled to think of φιοε
as infinite, can we conceive infinite space? We certainly annot mallee,
imagine. or picture tn ourselves infinite space. sor it would take nn infinlty
of time to do so. But thIs circumstance coustitutes no valid reason why
we should refuse to affirm ι proposition, the only alternative of which hu
been proved to be self-contmdictory. We are eompeued. therefore, tn
assei-t the proposition that Spnce is not finite, or, ln other words, the
Space is infinite.

Similarly, we cannot think of time as having had a beginning. for then
there would be a time before time; or as about to hue nn end, br then
there would be a time after time. Hence, we are compelled to affirm ιιι
infinity of time, as we were before compeued to affirm an lufiuity ot

space.
