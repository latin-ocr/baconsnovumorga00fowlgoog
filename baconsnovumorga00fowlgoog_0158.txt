brief notice of them.

In his Life os Newton (1855)⁸¹‚ Sir D. Brewster, irrita-ted apparently
by the injudicions statement of ‘some modern writers of celebrlty,'
that Newton ‘owed all his discoveries ιο the application οἱ the
principles of Bncon,¹ maintsins a. proposition equally extreme, und,
as it seems ιο me, equally unu-ue, that he did not ¹ derive the slightesz
advantage from Bacun‘s precepis.' For what 1 conceive ιο be a
remmtion os this position, 1 must refer the render beck to what 1
have already said on the relation os Newton to Bacon ''. ’Ta-king
occasion of this incidental mention of Becon, Brewster goes on ιο
combst his claime generally as a reformet· os scieuce. He argine.
or rather assem (for, except oi the first proposition, he adduces
hardly any prool'): ist, that ‘the necessity os experimenml recem-eh,
and of advancing gradually frorn the study of facts ιο the determina-

with regard to the last, is Sir D. Brewster means that a mere collection
of facte, without any play of the mind upon them (⁴permissio intel-

formation of hypotheses), is seldom or never likely to lead to dis-
