He is so anxious to solve every difficulty which presente itself ω
his mind, that he is seldom content with a bare statement of taces, witlant
starting some theory in explanation. of them. As a consequence of this
tendency, ibe facts are osten very meagre, and the theon'es very aude.

inlinity of elements, some of which were homopenous with others, thoizgh
in the original chaos they were all mixed up in inextricable confusion.
Thus, there existed from the first pai-[icles of flesh, hune, Rc.. which, by
a process of σύγκρισις and διάκρισις, have been disentangled from the dis-
orderly mass aud fashioned by νπῦι or the ευριπ-ωε intelligente into ssah,
bone, ἀι, as we now find them in the κόσμος or orderly universe. Πᾶνιιι
χρῆματιι ἦν ὀμοῦ· εἶτα νοῦς ἐλθὼν αὑτὸ διεκόσμησε. See Metapin- i. 3.

For the various philosophica! theorice mentioued in uuis paragraph, the
student should refer to the passages collected in Ritter aud Preuees Hk-
toria Philosophiae, as well as to some good History of Philosophy, such ns
that of nemi-weg, Zesser, οι· Lewes.

'⁸ These atoms, unlike the homoiomera of Anaxagoras, had no qun-
litative difference. They were supposed to differ only in shnpe (σχῆμπι)
as A and N, οι· arrangement (τάξει) as AN and NA, or position (θέσει) as
Ζ and N. The κόσμος resulted from these atoms through ἀνήη. See
Menapii. ι’. 4.

’⁶ Caelum et tem-nvp mi γῆ. lt is questionnble how far Parmenides
intended to express physica! concepimus by these words, and how far lie
intended them to be simply symbolic of the metaphysica contr-ast of being
and non-being. Τούτων δέ, mys Aristone, τὸ μὲν κατὰ τὸ ὃν, τὸ θερμὸν nim..

advantage, consult Schwegler's History os Philosophy, ln addition to
Ueberweg and muer and Preller.
