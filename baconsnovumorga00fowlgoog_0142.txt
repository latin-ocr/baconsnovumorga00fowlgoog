Philosophy. And although the arguing from experiments and ob·
servations by indu-:tion be no demonstration uf general conclusio-uz
yet itis the best way of arguing which the nature os things admits of,
and may he looked upon as so much the stronger, by how much the
induction is more general. And if no exception occur stom plne-
nomena, the conclusion may be pronouneed generally. But if at any

time afterwards any exception shall occur from expalmatum it may .

then begin to be pronounced, with such exceptione an occur. By
this way of analysis we may proceed stom compounds to ingredi-
ents; and from motione to the forces producing them and. in
general, from effecte to their causes; and from particular causet
to more general ones, till the argument end in the most genem!-
This is the met-hod of Analysis. And the Synthesis consiste in
assuming the causes discovered, and established as principles. end by
them explaining the phaenomena proceeding from them, and proving
the explanatione!

This passage, while undoubtedly showing, as it semus to me,
an acquaintance with the Baconian method, is remarkable ae denying
ω induction the force of demonstra-tion (a lirnitation which we may,
perhaps, account for from N ewton’s mathematica! habit of mind md the
prepondemnce οἷ his mathematical pursuits), as well as sor the fact
that it does not appear to recogi-nise any other form of induction than
that “per enumerationem simplicem! Both these circumstances
incline me to believe that Newton had not studied, or diti not
remember, or did not accept the teaching os the early pm of the
Second Book os the Novum Organum, though the precepta and
wamiags os the First Book. in their most general form, had produced
n deep impression upon him and had, in great measure, suggested
to him the aims and methods of bis own investigations ³⁵.

How then are we to account for his silence, as respecta the name
