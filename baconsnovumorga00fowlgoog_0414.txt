8. Per aurum et alia metalla ignita, quae densissimi mnt'
corporis secundum totum, rejice tenuitatem.

9. Per aerem, qui invenitur ut plurimum frigidus, et tamen
manet tenuis, rgjioe etiam tenuitatem.

10. Per serrum ignitum, quod non intumescit mole⁹⁰, sed
manet intra eandem dimensionem visibilem, rq‘ice
motum localem aut expansivum seeundum totum.

11. Per dilatationem aeris in vitris calendariis et similibus,
qui movetur localiter et expansive manifesto, neque

. tamen coll-igit manifestum augmentum caloris ⁹¹, njke
etiam motum localem aut expansivum secundum totum.

12. Per facilem tepefactionem omnium corporum, absque
aliqua destructione aut alteratione notabili, refice
naturam destructivam aut inditionem violentam alicujus
naturae novae.

13. Per consensum et conformitatem operum similium quae
eduntur a calore et a frigore, refice motum tam
expansi-vtum quam contractivum secundum totum.

14. Per accensionem caloris ex attritione corporum, rejice
naturam principialem Μ. Naturam principialem vo-

to raise the temperatur-e of a pound οἱ water through m degree Centi-
gmde, the then-mal units in round numbers disengaged by ι ponnd of
Absolute Alcohol and a pound of lron are respecti-sely 7¹80 and ¹57⁶-

⁸⁰ This statement is, of course, erroneous. But see notes on Apu. 24.

'¹ The sole cause of the expansion of the air is its increase in tempera-
ture, though, in so small a quantity of air as is contained in a tbermometer,
the increased temperature is not sensible to the touch: lt is the more
curicus that Baton should have fallen into this error, when we compare
what he says at the beginning of [nst. 38 of Apin. ι 3.

⁶ secundum totum· here and elsewhere is, of course, opposed to ‘per par-
ticuhs: lt is, perhaps, hardly necessary to notice the perverse interpren-
tion of this expression by Liebig as ‘on the whole;' as if Bacon meant that
in the majority of casm, but not in all, expanslon enters into the 'snm of
beat.¹ See Liebig's answer to Sigwart in the Aligemeine Zeitunss (Tchihat-
chef, p. ¹59)- What nacon obviously refers to is the motion of the entire
body, as distinct from that of the minute pan-ucles. Cp. Aph. ao, Tertia
Differentia.

¹⁸ Such would be the sca-called substance of caloric, which w& long sup·
poeed to be contained in bodies, and to be the cause of heat. The exet-
ence of this supposed substance was disproved by Rumsord nnd Dnvy.
