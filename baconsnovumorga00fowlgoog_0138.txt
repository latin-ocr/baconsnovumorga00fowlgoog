⁸ At rny request a young Omnian prepared me a. liat of fit, capable,
aad hopeful persons, addicted to the deaign of the Royal Society, md
willing to entertain coi-respondenda, and to mist in thern. They
seemed to me by their qualifimtious, and number, very consider-ablu
some in every college, and ἰιι every hall. Only in one college, there
was but one uamed; but it is excused. that his list was much too
short, and that he wanted time to complete it, and for some reasons
he would not be seen to advise with others sor fuller informationi.
There are excellent prosoesorS, some lecrurers, and very many studente
of useful arts amongst them. And in time they may have their
meetings in some of their publick schools, at'ter fit lecturee ς and the
wings of the stubbians ase already broken, *and their reputation
withers, as Dr. Bathurst told me! Boyle's Workz, Ed. of 1744,
vol. v. p. 498, b.

Mr. Napier‚ to whom 1 am indebted sor the two next reserenoee.
thinks that the ' new philosophy' had made still greater progress at
Cambridge. This conclusion is based mainly on a passage in Antony
Wood (Bliss's ed. os the Athenae Oxouiemaes, 1817, νοι iii. p. 1244),
who, in hia Life os Glanvill, ‘wonders cunsidering that that house
[Exeter College] was then one os the chief nnrseries sor youth in
the university, why he should afterwards lament that his friends did
not first send him to Cambridge, because, as he used to say, that
new philosophy and the art of philosophising were there more than
here in Oxon, and that his first studies in this university did not
quality him for the world os action and business-¹ This evidence,
which Σ have thought better to give in full, may not be of much
value as settling the claims os the rival Universities, but, at an events,
itis sufficient to shew that Cambridge had already a reputation fot
the ‘new philosophy! Of this, perhaps, we receive additional tati·
mony in Baker's Reflections upon learning, first publisbed in ¹⁶⁹⁹·
This author was a Fellow os St. John's college, Cambridge, and
is now well known sor his history ot* that College. reeently publiahed
and edited by Mr. Mayor. In the former work (Chapter on hagie),
after making some interesting remarks on the Method of nacon, he
proceeds: ‘After the way os free thinking’ (notice, again. this ex—
pression) · had been lai'd open by my Lord Bacon, it wan soon after
greedily sollow'd, for the Under-standing affects Freedom as well αι
the will, aud men will pursue liberty, tho it ends in confusion· p.59.
This reflection, however, may have simply a general reference, and
may not have been specially suggested by the experieuoe of the
writers own University. μ
