oldenburg. preserved by Antony Wood ¹⁸, says ‘he first seu in love
with the iord Baeou's philosophy in the year 1646: and who, in 1⁶⁶1„
published ι work entitled ¹ Britannia Baoonim, or the Natural Raritie·
of England, Scotland, and Wales, historieally related, according ω the
precepta of the Lord nacon ς’ together with many other writers whom
it voilld be tedicus to enumerate.

The authorities cited are, however, amply sufficient to prove the
two points which 1 was anxious to establish: κει, that the foundation
ol' the Royal Society in Engiand, and possibly also that of some
similar societies ou the Continent, was due to the impulse given by
Bacon to the study of experimental seience and the pians which be
devised sor its prosecution; and, that some of the more eminent men
who were amongst the earliest members os that society, Wanis, Boyie.
{Ic-olm, ἀει, were deeply imbued with the spirit of Bacon's metzing,
and ready sully to recognise their obligations to him. 11· these faet-
be established, aa 1 think they are, there can be no question aa ω the
reality of Bacon's influence on the progress of scienee in the gener-atton
immediately succeeding his own, whatever we may regard the nature
of that influence as having been ¹⁸.

Nor was the ‘New Philosophy· without ita influeuee on the Uni-
versities, much as those bodies were occupied at this time with other
questions, and deeply rooted as were their prejudicee in favour of
the old learning. Even is we pass ovet the Letter of the University
of Oxsordfl, written on receipt of Baeon'a De Augmentis in ¹⁶²3· in
which he is compared to a literar? Hercules, who has further advanoed
the pillara of learning, deemed by others immovable, as κνοω-ἤιε,
perhaps, too much ol' official flattery; and even is we reject. as teeti-
mony to himself. and, therefore, perhaps, partial, what he says in his
letter to the King⁵¹ about the reception of the Advanoement of

¹² Wood's Auzea-e Oxonienses. vol. iii. p. 904 (Ed. Bliss. ²817). According [ο
