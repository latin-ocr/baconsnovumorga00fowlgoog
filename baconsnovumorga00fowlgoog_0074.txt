iu various parts οῖ his νοτὶς, he attached to it two entirelydfflnct
meanings, which may be represented roughly by ¹ cauee¹ and ¹ essene&
but, as will appear fi-om the sequeL 1 am now of opinion that, though
the word has undoubtedly various chades of meaning in difl'etent
places, all these admit of derivation from a single conception. The
best course of proceeding¹ however, will be, first, to collect the
more important passages in which he attempta either to define the
term, or to state with precision the sense in which he accepts οι·
does not accept the investigation of ‘forms' as a legitimate brooch
of hia own philosophy.

The most striking passage os all, perhaps, is that in Νῦν. 013. i.
51: ‘Intellectus humanus fertur ad abstracta propter naturam pro-
priam. * ¹* Φ * Materia potiusconsiderari debet, et ejus schematiamk
et meta-schematum, atque actus purus, et lex actus sive momg
Formae enim commenta animi humani flunt, nisi libeat leges illas
actus Formas appellare? In strong contrast with this, is the passage
in De Augmemts. iii. 4 (E. and S.⁵ vol. i. pp. 564-568)‚ where he
states ‘inventionem Formarum ex omnibus scientiae partibus dig·
nissimam esse quae investigetur, si modo fieri possit ut reperiantur.
Ad inventionis possibilitatem vero quod attinet, sunt cette ignavi
regionum exploratores, qui ubi nil nisi coelum et pontum vident,
terras uln’a esse prorsus negant! This passage (which is fir too
long to be quoted at length) is well worthy οἶ the student's attention,
and should be read with care ¹¹. Ι may specially refer to the following
