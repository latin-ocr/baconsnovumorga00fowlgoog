which Newton inherioed directly l'rom the teaching of Bneon. And.
though the reaction against hypothesis was carried much too far, and
, though Baoon's utterances on this subject, to be serviceable at the
present time, require much rectification, the waming was one which.
in his own time, was surely needed, and which could hardly be
expressed in language too emphatic. Where authority was wanting,
ns is by way os revenge, men seerned to put no limi! to the wildnes·
of their fancies or the extravagance of their suppositions, Now, as
against both authority and hypothesis, Bacon invoked the maJesty of
facts. The office of Rea-son, he was, in effect, constantly snying,
ought not to be limited to an examination of the conclusione, and
their dependnnce on the premisses; what it ought to insist on doing,
is to examine the premisses themselves. What is required is a new
Logic, s. Logic of 1nducfion, which shall dn sor the premisses what
the old Logic, the Logic of Deduc-tion, does sor the conclusione. 12
is not enough that the conclusion follows from the premissa-⁵3 what
we require to know is whether the premisses themselves be tme, aad,
unless we can succeed in satissying this want, we may simply be
multiplying error instead ol* advancingvtruth. Had this been the only
iesson which Bscou read to his generation, he would, assuredijn have
deservecl to be recltoned amongst the greatest of its benefactors.

eth, But, to this Logic os Induction 1 maintain that he himself
made no contemptible contributione. That our instanoes require to
be selected and not merely accumulated, was a very true and ι very
'needsul lessnn which he was never weasy os repeating. And, surely,
in this maxim consiste the whole gist of the Inductive Logtc. On
what principles we shall select our instances, aud by what means we
shall satisfy ourselves os their sufficiency, are other and further quen-
tions, eonfessedly most difficult to answer, on which we could hardly
expect much detailed or permanently useful informstion from a
pioneer in this method os inquiry. And yet Bacon is very sun on
at least the first ol* these questions. and much os what he says has,
even still, a value sor the student. But we are now concerned, we
must recollect, not with the present value of 111⁸ works, but with their
past inssuence. Now, to the amount of that influence, with respect to
the subject before us, what better testimony can we have than the
repetition of these mles in the next generatim: by so eminent a man
of science as Dr. Robert Hooke. or the appropi-iatine, emendation,
and formulstinn of them, ss the bases of their own methods, almost
within our own time, by Sir John Herschel and Mr. Mill? Nor is it
an unimponant consideration that such phrases as ‘ glaring instantem·
