attempting tn extract123 while, in the wide field of mmm, the harvest
was ready, though the labourers were sev. And so Bacon oontented
himself with working in what appeared to him the more prunising
field of labour. He sought God in nature, and there he reoognieed.
revereneed, and adon-ed Him. The same God was eleo to be found
in the ark ol* the Church, and the pages of the Bible3 bnt nmo-ru
testes and pursnits lay another wey, and hence, though he lud no
inclination to call in question the leading verities os fasth, he received

lndifference.

⁷¹1²· This last consideration may afford some explanation os the
two other points to which Ι shall eall attention. One of thece is
the evident preference which Bacon accords to Atheism over Super·
stition. ‘ It were better to have no opinion of God at au, than meh
an opinion ns is unworthy of him. For the oue is unbelief. the
other is¹ contumely: and certainly superstition is the reproach οἱ
the Deity. Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Sur-thr (saith he) lhad
raam a great deal men should my there was no such man a! 011 as
Plutanh, than thal they should styt that there was one Plutarch ebat
would ea! his children as soon as they were born ,· as the poete speak
of Sarum. And as the contumely is greater towards God, so the
danger is greater towards men. Atheism leaves a man to sense, to
philosophy, ιο natural piety‚ to laws, to reputation 3 all which may
be guides to an oum-ard mox-al virtue, though religion 'were not: bnt
superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monnrchy
in the minds of men. Theresore atheism did never perturb state· ;
sor it makes men wary os themselves, as looking no further: und
we see the times inclined to atheism (ss the time os Augustus Cant)
were civil times. But superstition hath been the confusion of many
states, and bringeth in a new primum mobile, that ravisheth all the
spheres of governrnent ²⁴! In this passage, 1 think, Bacon thoroughly
represents the spirit of his time. The reeoil from the superstitious
of the Church of Rome, and especially from the dangers with which
the machinations of that Church seemed to threaten the civil power,
had become, in the resonned countn'es, so intense, and most eo
unreasoning, that men could concere of no opinions equally cingemus
either to the well-being of the individua} conscience or to the security
