period of his life, men might be well excused who suspended meir
judgment, or who even preferred to adhere to the old assumption tin

their objections to the new theory were removed. The following

sentences from Mr. De Morgan'· are so apposite, and read a les-on

so universally useful to us, in estimating the scientific iudgments of

men in past ages, that 1 arn sure my readers will be grateful ω

me sor mnemibing them. ‘By investing Copernieus with a systum

which requires Galileo, Kepler, and Newton to explain it, and their

pupils to understand it, the modern astronomer refers the want of

immediate acceptant-e of that system to ignorance, prejudice, and

over adherenee to antiquity. No doubt alt these things mn be traoedz

but the ignorance was of a kind which belonged equally to the

panisans and to the opponens, and which fairly imposed on the pm-

pounder of the system the onus of meeting arguments, which, in the

period we speak of, he did not and could not meet.. It must be

remembered that, in the sixteenth century, the wit of man could not

imagine how, if the earth moved, a stone thrown directiy upwards

would tumble down upon the spot it was thrown from. Easy ex·
