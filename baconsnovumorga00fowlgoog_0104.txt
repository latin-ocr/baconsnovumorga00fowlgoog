connn adversus peripateticos Parisiis propositorum. ln the Dedin-
tion prefixed to this work, he says that he should not bave written the
book. had he thought that the University of Paris owed more to
Aristode, than Aristone to it. In the celebrated Dblogue, entituled
‘La Cena de le Generi: Brimo states that the most enthusiastic ad-
herente οῖ Aristode (‘who are the enemies of those who are not the
friends οἳ Aristode, who would live and die for Aristotle') are often
entirely ignorant os the meaning of even the titles os his vorke (‘i
quali non intendono ne anche quel che significant) i titoli de libri
d'Aristotele'). He adds that the real question which ought to be
debated between the Aristotelians and their opponente is not whether
a doctrine be old or new, but whether it be true or false ’¹.
campanella (b. 1 563‚d. 1639) was an enthusiastic sonower ol Telesia,
and one os the more outspoken of the anti-Aristotelians. One of his
works, published at Naples in ¹59¹· was entituled Philosophia sene
sibus demonstrata ; adversus eos qui proprio arbitratu, non autem
sensata duce natura philosophati sunt: cnm vera defensione Bes-nardi
Telesii. The Prel'ace to this work, written in ¹589, abounds in open
or covert attacks on Aristotle. Campanella's objections to the phi-
losophy of Aristode were based as much on theologica] as on philoso-
phica] grounds. In a work entituled Disputatio in Prologum Insanum·
tarum Scientiarum ad Scholas Christianae, praesertim Pafisienses, the
reader will find a very curious list of these theologica] objections.

M. A, Severinus⁹⁵ (b. 1580, d. 1656), a junior contemporary of
Bacon, and, like campanella, a follower of Telesins, was mainly a
writer of medical works. One of these is inscribed Antipen'patias,
hoc est adversus Aristotelem, de respiratione piscium‚' ᾱο. Like
Bacon, he attacks Aristode for his treatment of the older Greek
Philo-sopher& Thus, he quotes with approbationi the words os Cabneus,
the last author on our list, when describing Aristotle as ‘adeo male
meritus de antiquis, dum semper in peiorem sensum interpretatur. ut
proinde dignus esset, qui ab omnibus male acciperetur, nee unquarn'
