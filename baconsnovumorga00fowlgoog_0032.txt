work of postu-ny, Bacon hoped himself mo supply ‘initia nou enn-
temnenda! For any special treatise, however. which ean be referred
to this head, we search in vain amongst his works. Nor is this
fact without its explanation. The Scientia Activa was tovdepend
un the knowledge of 'Forms‚' but bow far Baton was from having
atmined to a knowledge of ⁶ Forma: and how vague was the concep-
tion which he osten attached ιο this term, will be only too familiar to
the anentive student oi· the Novum organum. The story which he
applies to the Alchemiets¹⁸ os the old man who bequeathed to his
sons a piece os gold hidden in a vineyard applies also, in no small
measure, to himself. He did not discover ⁵ Fon-mss but he did what
was of sar more value to posteriiy; he recalled mento the observationi
of facts, gave an impulse to the study os nature, and, if not the

founder of the Inductive Method, at least conuibuted more than any
other man to its wider, more correct, and more fruifful employmem.

In one os his articles in the Allgemeine Zeimng (Nov. 3, 1863),
Liebig asseris roundly :hat Baton wrote none of his works in Latin:
that [hey were translated by people who knew nothing os the subJects
ol* which they treated, and, as Bacon was not very clear upon them
himself, we may imagine the result! In another article (March 6,
2864), he is especially angry with Sigwart sor having called in
question ihis asset-tion, and rein-‚rates dogmatically the statement
that all the Latin works os Bacon required the intervention os a
nmnslmor. The proos is a letter from Bacon ιο Dr. Playser of
Cambridge (given in Spedding's Life and Lenem, vol. iii. pp. 300,
301), requesting him to undertake the translation os the Advance-
ment of Learning. Liebig argues that, if, at the age of fol-tyzsix
(he should have said about the age of forty-six nr forty-seven 3 sor
[here is nothing enabling us to fix the exact date of this letter), and
when he had but few engagements, Bacon did not recognise his
aptitude for translating his first scientific work imo Latin, it is hardly
likely that he would possess mis aptitude in his sixtieth year, when he
held high office under the Crown, and was immersed in business.
Now. there is nothing whatever in Bacon's letter ῑο Playfer which
either assei-ts or implies inaptimde to write Latin. And, as to being
