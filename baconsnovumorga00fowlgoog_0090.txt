70 INTRODUCTJON.

for example, that it has only one hone in its neelt, but no cervina
vertebrae (Hiat. An. ii. x (3) ), the story that the hen-putridae
is impregnated by hearing the voice or smelling the breath of the
male bird (De Gen. Anim. iii. 1 (26, ἀπ’.) ), and the statement,
adopted probably from Herodotus, that the crocodile moves ite upper
jaw (Hist. An. i. ιι (ιο) aud iii. 7 (4) ). For additional instance& see
the Article in the Quarterly Review, above referred to. Sometimes, as
in the ease ol* the cranium of the dog, which he supposes to censis« ol*
a single bone (Hist. An. iii⁴ 7 (3) ), it is difficult to say whether the mia-
take is due to defective observationi or to the unsuspeeting reception
of a popular belief, or, lastly, to over-hasty generalisatiou.

(4) The fault just noticed was also undoubtedly the cause of many
of Aristotle'a errors. Though, perhaps, he was not without the oon-
ception of seientific induction ”, yet the form of induction which he
usually employa is that of Simple Enumeration. And, as the enume-
ration of instantes must, in most cases, necessarily be ιαιιιιγ, be
naturally lapsed into the habit of generalising on inaufficient data.
The selectim os instances as distinct from their mmeratt‘on (the point
on which Bacon so constantly and emphaticafly insist-s) would, doubt-
lesa, have done much to transfor-m the philosophy of the time, aud to
accelerate the progress of science. But itis precisely this differ-enee
which distinguishes modern from ancient induction. As 1 have elee-
where (see Inductive Lugio, ard Ed„ pp. 275, ecc.) spoken at nome
length on this defeci in Aristode's method, I shall not dwell on itin
this place. It may be described, from different points of view, either
as hasty genemlisadon, or as the use of Inductio per Enumerationem
Simplicem in place of Scientific Induction,

(5) Another most important cause of sailure ia to be found in
Aristosse's vagae use of general terms. Words like motion, hot and
cold, moist and dry, heavy and light, generation and corruption,
natural and unnatural, ‹S‘cc¹¹ are employed simply in their populas
acceptation, without any attempt to give them a definite and precise
meaning. The problems proposed sor solution being thus wanting
in precision‚ it is not surprising that the results arrived at are vague
and unscientific. Under this head, cp. Herschel on the Study of
Natural Philosophy, Part ii. ch. 3, and Whewell’s History of the

“ Inductive Seleucea, Eook i. ch. 2. sect. a.
