post inventionem formarum, et processuum, et schematis-
morum, futuris temporibus apparebit. At ista effecta magica
(quantum adhuc conjicimus) fiunt tribus modis: aut per
multiplicationem sui Μ, ut in igne, et venenis, quae vocant
specifica. ⁶⁷3 necnon iu motibus, qui transeunt et sortifimntur
de rota in rotam ⁵³ : aut per excitationem ⁶⁰ sive invitationem
in altero, ut in magnete, qui excit acus innumeras, virtute
nullatenus deperdita aut diminutam aut in fermento, et hujus-
modi: aut per anteversionem motusffl, ut dictum est de pulvere
pyn‘o, et bombardis, et cuniculis: quorum priores duo modi
indagationem consensuum requirunt; tertius, mensurae mo-
tuum. Utrum vero sit aliquis modus mutandi corpora per

⁶⁷ By a Specific Poisou is properly meant a poison which is invariably
attended by the same group of sequelae, ln appositior· tn a pobon, the
effect of which is different under different circumstances and on different
constitutions. Most specffic polmus, such ns small-pax, mensles, the
Morbus Gallicus, &c.‚ possess the power of aelf-multiplication, but this 1⁸
not an invariable property of such poiseus. Thus, in lucifer-match manu-
factorles, phosphorus produces nect-osis of the lower ,iam and may, thm-
fore, be regarded as a specific poison, but lt does not nct by way of
sels-multiplicantium

ln ii. 48 (η), nacon refers the aetion of ‘some poisons' tothe ‘metm
excitationis·

³⁸ This is the principle of the Wheel and Axle. But, as Mr. Kltchin
observes, the ‘ fortifioetio motus ' takes place at the expense of speed.

⁶⁸ See Aph. 48 (η). ’

‘⁰ See ii. 36 (7), 48 (ιο). The motion of the nitro, from its abhonnnee
of fleme, is supposed to ‘ usseipate' that of the sulphur.

minima ’ in i. 5⁰· This is the second of the two moden of transformia,
spokn of at the beginning of ii. 5.

Aphorisms nt the beginning of this Book, with the notes. On the trans-
mutation of the metals, there are some very carlom nnd interesting
remarks in the Historia Densi et Rari, E. nnd 8., vol. ii. pp. nso-1. Thu-e
he gives it ns his opinion thnt other bodie cannot be turned into Gold‚ on
account of its superior density, but that we may hope to effect the conver-
