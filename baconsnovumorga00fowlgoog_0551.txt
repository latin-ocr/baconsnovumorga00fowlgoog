geneorum inter se coeundi et se uniendi⁷⁸. Differ-t autem l
iste motus a motu indigentiae, in duobus. Uno, quod in
motu indigentiae sit stimulus major naturae malignae et
contrariae; at in hoe motu (si modo impedimenta et vincula
absint) uniuntur partes per amcitiam, licet absit natura aliena
quae litem moveat: altero, quod arctior sit unio, et tanquam
majore cum delectu. In illo enim, modo evitetur corpus inimi-
cum ⁷⁹, corpora etiam non admodum cognata concurrunt3 at in
hoc cocunt substantiae, germana plane similitudine devinctae,
et conflantur tanquam in unum. Atque hic motus omnibus
corporibus compositis inest; et se facile conspiciendum in
singulis daret, nisi ligaretur et fraenaretur per alios corporum
appetitus et necessitates, quae istam coitionem disturbant.
Ligatur autem motus iste plerumque tribus modis: torpore
corporum ς fraeno corporis dominantis; et motu externo. Ad
torporem corporum quod attinet; certum est inesse corporibus
tangibilibus pigritiam quandamffl‘ secundum magis et minus, et
exhorrendam motus localis; ut, nisi excitentur, malint statu

'¹¹ Au excellent illustration of Bacon's meaning may be found in the
commonly received opinion with regard to the formation of fflnt nodulos.
See Phutips’ Manual uf Geolossy‚ pp. 358—9, or Page's Advauced Text Book
of Geology, ⁶th Ed.. pp. 350-4. The latter suthm- discusse: the quatior·
at some length, and concludes: ‘ From those facts it would seem that fliuu
are aggregatio& of silex round some organic nucleus, Just like the iromone
septen-ia οἱ the conl-mles, the grains of the nolite, the ironstone nodulss of
the gault-au of which πε aggregatim round some organis: centn-e, be it n
fragment of plant, a sinen, ι tooth, coprolite, οι· other organista. This lx
now the generally received <minium aud when it is muembeoed that the
organisms mim have been depodted when the dzalk was in ι floeeulent
and pulpy state, there ωτι be little difficulty in conceiving how the allex,
held in solution by the waters of deponit, would, by ehemiml affluar,
attach itself to the decaying organism.¹ Dr. Bowerbank appu-s a similar
theory even to beds of tabula:- fflnt, supp-using that the spongo: originaung
the deposit had developed themselves latei-³117, and that, approaching and
touching each other, they united and thus forumd extensive and continuom
beds. On the formation of nodules generally, see also Lyell's Student’s
Elements of Geology, and Ed„ p. 4ο.

²⁸ As we have seen under ¹ Motus Sextus: this idea of the ‘ corpis immi-
cum ⁷ is, in many cases, fanciful.

'¹' This ia the property of bunia, and it is worth noting that Baton
refers to st} but it mist be remembered that this property, as we eon-
ceive it, applies equally to moving bodies, which would go nn moving for
ever, is there were nothing externa! to stop them.
