prevailed.

The *section of my Introduction which treats of Bacon’s
Influence on Philosophy and Science should have contained
some notice of the testimony os Barrow, an account of which
will be found in Whewell's Philosophy os Discovery, pp.
177-9. This author, writing· in 1652, had evidently, as Dr.
Whewell mys, ‘ read the Novum Organum in a caresul and
intelligent manner, and presumed his Cambridge hearers to
be acquainted with the work?

In *this section (ρ, 108), I have referred, following Mr.
Macvey Napier, to Comenius (b. in Moravia 1592, d. 1671,
many of whose works were published at Leszno in Poiand),
as having in his Physicae Synopsis spoken in laudatory
terms of Bacon. But 1 was not aware, till Mr. Partison
directed my attention to the fact, that the educational
works of Comenius are so full os allusions to Bacon, or
that the thoughts and modes os expression of this writer
are so Baconian in character as 1 find to be the case. If
any rcader cares to pursue this subject, he will finci an ex-
cenent example of what I mean in the Pansophici Libri
Delineatio (occupying pp. 403-456 os the first Part of the
Opera Didaetica,published at Amsterdam‚ in 1657). speaking
of mles for distinguishing the true from the salse, Comenius
says: ‘Atque talem normam in natura scrutanda reperisse
visus est Illustrissimus Verulamius, artificiosam quandam in-
ductionem, quae revera in naturae abdita penetrandi reclusa
via est. Verum enimvero, quia haec phu-ium hominum
et seculorum continuatam industriam poscit, atque adeo turn
operosa, tum a successu quasi incerto suspensa videtur, fit,
ut praeclarum inventum a plerisque tanquam inutile con·
temnatur! In a previous passage, he asks: ‘Non est nihil.
quod Vemlamius mirabili suo organo rerum naturas intime
scrutandi modum infallibilem detexit? This work was pub-
lished at Oxford in the year 1637, under the title os Conatuum
Comenianorum Praeludia.

In the Presace to the Physicae ad Lumen Divinum
Resomatae Synopsie, Arust. 1643, referred to in my Intro-
duction, he speaks os the Instauratio Magna as ‘opus
