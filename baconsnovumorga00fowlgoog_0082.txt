62 INTRODUCTION.

Δ third remark is one which 1 heve frequently had occasion
to make in the notes on the early Aphorisme of the Second Book,
namely, that the whole of the enquiry into Form. and, consequenti„ the
Method os Exclusione, proceeds on the assumption that every
phenomenon has only one muse, that is to say, is due to only one
set of conditions. Of the ‘simple namres' theoe is some one, end
one only, which, is it could be found, is the ‘Fortu’ of the ‘natum
data! ¹ 'rum vero post rejectionem et exclusivam debitis modis fictam,
secundo loco ⁸ ⁸ ‘¹ manebit ⁸ ‘ ‘¹ forma affirmativm' But the same
event, ns is so osten and so justly insisted on by Mr. Mill, whenever
he has pecasion to speak of what he teu-ms 'Pluraliry of Causa:
may be due to one set of mnditions at one time and to a different
set of conditions at another. (On Baoon's neglect of this consideration,
see Mill's Logic, bk. v. ch. 3. ξ 7.) Hence, though it is invariably
true that the mine cause ἱς always followed by the same effect,
the converse proposition that the same effect is always due tothe
same cause would frequently be misleading. Os Bncon¹s criteria οἱ a
Form, therefore, aa well as of the exclusion os a. Form, some, as
1 have pointed out in the notes on Aphs. 15 and 16 os Book ii,
are vitiated through his ignon'ng this circumstance.

1 may remark, lastly, that the force of Bacon's argument is much
more apparent, as well as really greater, when stated affirmatively
than negatively. Is the connection between two phenomem οι·
‘ommes‘ satisfies all the requirements of the Inductive Methods (and.
on a liberal interpretation. we may regard all these requirements
as smed in Nov. Org. ii. 15), we ere surely justified, without going
through any ‘exclusion’ of other natures, in affirming a musal
rela1ion between them. On the other hand, however large the
number of ‘namres’ which we can sueceed in excluding, we mn
hardly ever be cenam, in the present state of knowledge or my
which we are likely to attain, that we have excluded all but one.
And, even supposing we were able to anain this cernintffi how do
we know, unless we have some positive evidence, that the remaining
nature is the cause or ¹ [οι-ιη’ ol' the given nature? Might they not
both be, so sar as our knowledge reaches, ultimate facts os nauare.
uniformities os coexistence, like Inertia and Gravity·⁸? That namn
should have overlooked this objection to hie method is the more
remarkable, when we take into account Aph. 48 of Book i, where he
