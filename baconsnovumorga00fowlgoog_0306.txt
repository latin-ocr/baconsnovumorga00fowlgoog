286 ΝΟ V UM ORGANUM.

Quinetiam, ut nunc sunt res, conditio sermonum de natura
facta est durior et magis cum periculo, propter theologorum
scholasticorum summas et methodos3 qui cum theologiam
(satis pro potestate) in ordinem redegerint, et in artis sormam
effinxerint, hoc insuper effecerunt, ut pugnax et spinosa
Aristotelis philosophia ⁵⁴ corpori religionis, plus quam par
erat, immisceretur.

Eodem etiam spectant (licet diverso modo) eorum corn·
mentationes, qui veritatem Christianae religionis ex principiis
ex authoritatibus philosophorum deducere et confirmare haud
veriti ειη-ιτς fidei et sensus conjugium tanquam legitimum
multa pompa et solennitate celebrantes, et gram rerum
varietate animos hominum permulcentes3 sed interim divina

humanis, impari conditione, permiscentes. At in hujusmodi
misturis theologiae cum philosophia, ea tantum, quae nunc in

there were antipodes r and is not pope NiehoIas deserted by his own party
for correcting the sennons οῖ Berenfflirius„ and making him reennt 111oe
a worse error? and poster-{ty will certainly make themselves very merry
with the wise sentences made lately at Rome against Galileo nnd the
Jansenists. To condemn one truth is more shameful than to'broach tvo
eri-ors: for he that in an honest and diligent enquiry misses something of
the mark, will have the apologia of human infirmity, and the pruine of
doing his best; hut he that condemns a truth when it is told him, is
an envious sooi, and is a mnrderer of his brother's fiune, and his brothers
reason:

Mr. Mili diecmses the incapacity of conceiving the existence οῖ Antipodes
in two places os his Logic, nameiy, bk. ii. ch. 5. § 6, aud bhv. ch. 3.
§ 3. It is, perhaps, superfluous to remark, with reference to these
passages, tint Mr. Mlli’s views as to the relation of inconceivabffity tn
impossibility are combated by Mr. Hei-bert Spencer.

⁸⁴ ln the corresponding passage of the Cogitata et visa (E. and 8.,
p. 596)‚he says: ‘hoc insuper ausi sunt, ui. contentiosam et tumulus-
ariam Aristotelis philosophiam corpori religionis inseruerint:

n has osten been remarked that the distinguit—king characteristic οῖ the
scholastic theology was the union of theologica] matter with a dialectiea!
form, the theologie-al matter being derived from the Scriptures and the
fathers, and the dialectica! form from the Logic of Aristone. But with
the form, no inconsiderable portion of the matter of the Aristotelian
philosophy, especially in the domains os psychoiogy and metaphyniu,
frequently effected nn entrance, and thus, to a certain extent, detes-mimi
both the terminoiogy end the doctrines of the Medlaeval Chardi. ln
illustration of this statement, see Bishop Hampden's Bampton tactui-et,
n work which well deserve- the attention both of the theologica! and
the philosophica! student.
