in the Aditus ad Historiam Gravis et Levis (E. and S„ vol. ii. p. 80),
and in the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis, cap. 7 (E. and S.. vol. iii.
p. 762). In the last passage, it is only sair to add, he refers to
Gilbert. I may also add that in the Sylva Sylvarum, Exp. 704,
Bacon shews a very just conception of the nature os gravity‚ when
he says that it ‘is a mere motion os matter, and hath no affinity with
the form or kind.¹ ,

On subsidiary points connected with Astronomy, 1 may adduce as
examples os Bacon's sagacity the fact that he saw that there must be
some reason why the heavens rotate from east to west, or, as we
should put it, why the earth rotates from west to east ⁶, the idea of the
possibility of predicting comets ⁷, and his recognition os the probable
or possible influence os the moon on the spring and neap tides ⁸.

In Nov. Org. ii. 46, we have the brilliant conjecture that the actual
state of the starry sky precedes by an interval of time that which is
apparent to us, in other words, that light requires time for its trans-
mission. ‘ Atque hoc, cum similibus, nobis quandoque dubitationem
peperit plane monstrosam; videlicet, utrum coeli sereni et stellati
facies ad idem tempus cernatur quando vere existit, an potius
aliquanto post ς et utrum non sit (quatenus ad visum coelestium)
non minus tempus verum, et tempus visum, quam locus verus, et
locus visus, qui notatur ab astronomis in parallaxibus. Adeo incredi-
bile nobis videbatur, species sive radios corporum coelestium per tam
immensa spatia milliarium subito deferri posse ad visum; sed potius
debere eas in tempore aliquo notabili delabi.' Unfortunately, Bacon
proceeds to explain away his conjecture by arguments almost as
perverse as the thought itself is felicitous ⁹.

⁸ Nov. Org. ii. 48 (¹4)· For the generalisation, or rather approximate gener-alisa—
tion, os this proposition, and the probable cause os the phenomenon, see my notes
on the passage.

⁷ De Augmentis, iv, 3 (E. and S.. vol. i. p. 558). ‘Praedictiones fieri possint de
Cometis futuris, qui (ut nostra sert conjectura). praenunciari possunt, et de omni
genere meteorurn,' διε. It must be mnfcssed. however. that he then goes on to
speak os the prediction os wars, seditions, schisms, &c. Moreover, the same ques-
tion was discusscd in the time os Seneca, and even earlier. See Nat. Quaest.‚ lib.
vii. capp. 5, 4. 19, ²⁵- The last of these chapters is peculiarly interesting.

⁸ See Nov. Org. ii. 45, 48 (9). In my note on the former passage, 1 have spoken
of Bacon's change of opinion on this subject. On the causes os the semi-diumal
ebb and flow he seems to have been inclined to adopt an entirely different opinion.
