expressed, or already admitted of being expressed, in ι mathemate-1
form. Hence, we cannot be surprised if the mutes os eopemtcus,
Galileo‚ and Kepler had sor Newton a greater attraction than unt
of Bacon, though it by no means follows that he regarded him
otherwise than with respect and admiration, or that he would not
have been ready fully to express his obligations to him §or having
insisted ou raising the supet-structure of experimenta, md therefore
ultimately οἱ all seleuce, on the true inundatione of observation,
experiment, and induction.

Having now, as 1 conceive, sueceeded in establishing the fact of
Bacon's influence on the progress os science, 1 have next to ask what
the nature of that influence was. ΤΙιε title of founder or father of
experimenta} philosophy, ascribed to him by Maciaurin end athas,
expresses the nature of his influence in a mugh, and, perhaps, a
somewhat exaggemted as well as a somewhat inadequate form, but
one which, I think, is, in the main, true. Instead, however, of
criticising this' or similar expreseions, it is better that 1 should ame
precisely the conclusimus on this subject at thch 1 have myself

selves alongside of nature, to etudy her ways, and imitate her proeesse«.
To use his own homely simile, he tang the bell which called the other
wits together ”. Other men indeed had said much the same thing in
whispers or in learned books written for a circle os select readern
but Bacon cried it from the house-mps, and invited all men to come
in sreely and pat-take of the feast. In one word. he popularieed the

and, He insisted, both by example and precept, on the importunae
of experimen-it as well as observation. Nature, like a witness, when
put to the turture, would reveal her secrete. &periment-tion was
undoubtedly common in Baeon's time, but it was generally associated
with the Alchemists, and so, while it suffered in reputation, it was
confined in range. Bacon gave it an ειιετιεὶοη, a dignity, a popu-
larity which, it is not too much to say, must have materially influe-need
the labours of the Royal Society, and the crowning effom of Boyle
end Newton.
