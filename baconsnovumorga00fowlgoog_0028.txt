in the Partis Secundae Denuntio, as ΜΓ. Spedding remarks in his

ceming those parta of the inductive process which were to have
been developed in the third hook of the Novum organum! Ap«
pended to the Delineatio in Ellis and Spedding's Edition is a tract
called Redargutio Philosophiarum ⁸, which, says Mr. Spedding,
‘may be considered as the first chapter of the second part of the

of an attach upon preceding systems οἰ philosophy, and, though
designed to be part of the work oi which the Delineatio is the
sirach, was probably not composed till some time afterwards ’-
Closely resembling the Redarguti0‚ but sar more arrogant in its
tone, is the extant portion of another work entitled Temporis
Partus Masculus, sive De 1nterpretatione Naturae Libri Trea. Of
this the first and second chapters only exist, the second, as ΜΓ.
Spedding thinks, wn'tten at a considerable interval aster the first,
though before the Redargotio. This second chapter goes over the
same ground as the Redargutio and the aphorisma on the Idola
Theatri in the Novum Organum, but is written in a peculiarly arro·
gant, not to say, insolent tone. Mr. Spedding conjectures, Ι think
rightly, that this arrogance and exaggemtion arcto be explained on
the supposition that Bacon was making an experiment in the art of
commanding attention and wir-ming disciples¹⁹. Π he spoke lond
enough, and used sufficiently strong language, he thought he might
compel mento listen to him. To me the whole perfonnance seems
to have a strained and almost theatrical character.
