difficult even to criticise them. He speaks aa one having nnffledty,
and it ia impossibne ιο resist the magic os his voice. Whenever he
wishes to be emphatic, there is the. {zue ring os genius about al! tim

there is no author so stimulat-ing. Bucen might well be oessed the

§ ¹5· PRESENT VALUE OF BAcon’s LOGICAL wmucs,

Thia subject has already, to a great extent, been discuoeed in the
latter pazt of the last section, aud it will be unnecessvsy here ω add
much to what has thete been said. The two questions, however.
os Bacon's influence during the past, and the vulne of his νοτὶς ω

separate treatment, however much they may run into each other.

The intrinsic value os Bacon’s logical workz to the student a: the
present time, apart from their historia] interest, ns having, ω adopt
the fine saying of Macaulay. ‘ moved the intellects which have moved
the wor1d‚' may be briefly confidet-ed under two aspects. The fim
os these is their general effect in guarding, sfimuhfing, and dbeiplining
the intellect; the second is the amount os definite logical docum.
comprised in them, which retains any permanent valae.

With regard to the first point, Ι know no work of the sume und
