338 NOVUM ORGANUM.

(ista. enim vocabula habemus, quae ad indicationem rei prox-
ime accedunt) invenire, opus et intentio est humanae scien-
tiae ⁶. Atque his operibus primariis subordinantur alia opera
duo secundaria et inferioris notae3 priori, transformatio cor-
porum concretorum de alio in aliud. intra terminos Possibilis“;
posteriori, inventio in ouini generatione et motu latentis pro-
cessus'f, continuati ab efficiente manifesto et materia mani-

quaiity, or of the aggregate of'ell objecta and quantia, the vniversa,
at any given time; Natura Naturalis is the immanent cause of this cou-
dition, or aggregate of conditione, and is regarded as producing it by a
continuous proces. Thus, when we say ⁸ how wonderfuuy Nature works:
we are speaking of“Nnmrn Naturans;' when we sny ‘how beautiful is
Nature,' we are speaking of Natura Nalm-ata. Hence, Natura Naturam
is related to Natura Naturata as cause to effect. Or, again, we may ny
that Natura Naturam is the active οι· dynamicai, Natum Natumta the
paffiive οι· statice] aspect of Nature. lt wili be easily understood from this
account how Natura Nam-ans, in nome systems of philosophy, ns, foi·
instance, in that of spinum, came to denote God as the immanent eume
of the Universe.

ln employing ‘ natura uatumns’ and ‘fons emnnationis' as the equiva-
lents of ¹ form: Bacon seems to be adopting a point of view slightly dif-
ferent from that which he takes, where he describes it as ¹ vera differentia·
But, perhaps, we may exhibit the identity οἱ these various expressions, by
saying that the ‘data natura· results froin the ‘form' in the seme way
that the secondery propemes flow fnum the primax-y (³diffexentie κη’),
ot· the attributes from the substance, or effects in nature from the induren-
ing muse. 1. am, however, inclined to think thet in this μειβ the word
¹ form’ is really employed, though, of conse, unconsciously, with tvo difi-
ferent §hedes οἰ meaning, namely, as the equivalent of ‘eesenoe’ (‘ dif-
ferentia vera') and of ‘cause' (‘ natura natnrans, sive sons emanationis ¹).
For an explanation of these two mennings, and an attempt at reconcilies
them, see Introduction, ὁ 8.

⁶ For the connection between ‘seientinet potentinum-,⁸ quma ἰ.

· The idee ofvthe transmutationi of* one body into another, eod spedessr.
of metuis, is of frequent occurrence in Bneon's wei-its, and is speci-117 in-
sisted on in Liebig's invective against÷ the Emanium philosophy. ‘Tne
pamma-ys says Mr. Ellis, ‘of tmusmutntion, long and suenuoudy denied,
though certainly on no sufficient grounds, is now geoenily admitted.
