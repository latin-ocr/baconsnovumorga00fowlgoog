Sicut scientiaeffl, quae nunc habentur, inutiles sunt ad iu-
vetitionem opertum ita et legioni, quae nunc habetur, inutilis
est ad inventionem scientiarum.

To the same effect we find a passage in Galileo’s Dialogo dei Massia-i
Sisteml, Giornata Prima (Sir Thomas Salusbury's Translatiom pp. 8⁴, 89:

Sagredus. ‘I ever accounted extraordinary madness that of thone who
wmxld make human comprehensim the mensure of what nature bath a
power or· knowledge to effect; whereas on the contrary there is not any
the least effect in Nature. which cun be fully understood by the most
speculative wite in the world. This their so vain presumptioni ofknowiug

¹⁰ A post-classica word. ‘Controversia' Du Gange explains it z
‘ Lis, controversia, placitum,' and, amongst other authorities, quotes Gregor-
Magn. lib. i. epist. 9: ‘ Fines, de quibus causatio mota ως· Concilium
Arelatenae, an. 813. cau. 16: ¹ Ne in Dominicis diebus publicae mere-tae,
neque causationes disceptationesque exerceantur:

The word occurs in the sense of an ‘excuse' or ‘apology' as early
ns ‘the time os Aulus Gellius (⁸Atque id fecerunt ne causatio ista aegri
eorporis perpetuam vacationem daret fidem detrectantibus, jurisque ae-

seem tn be its meaning in this place.

'rhough the scholastic logie recognised inducti-:m as a form of rwoning,
it sailed to see its importance, and had not attempted to iay dmm any
rules for its employment. Hence, practicauy, it was exclusively a syuo-
gistic logie. Now it is the function of syllogism to develope the eou-
sequences of a principle, not to examine the principle itself. But, unless
we examine the principie, how can we be certain of the trud: of the
consequences? We may oniy be multlplying error instead of truth. The
conclusion of every new syllogism may be only one error the more, aad,
from the false confidente which the mene reiteration οῖ ι μωροάίίω
