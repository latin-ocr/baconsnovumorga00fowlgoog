⁸¹ This ξιιμ-θεάσῃ is the scholastic equivalent for the Aristotelian term
ἐνέργεια or δνηλίχιια ns opposed to δῦναμις, and, as such, may either nnenn
actual, as opposed to possible motion, grmvth, or development, or actual, a
opposed to possible existence. For a δύναμις may either be a possibility of
motion (taking that word in its wide, Aristotelian sense), or a pofflility of
existence. if it be a possibility ot* existence, the existence itale, when
tenlised, is called an ἐνέργεια or ἐντελέχεια. But, if it be a possibility of
motion, we have two casm, according as the motion or process is (ι) an end
in itselfi or (ι) results in something* beyond itself, an ἔργον τι. Now, in the
first cnse, as, for instance, in wanting for the sake of exereise, the actm! an
opposed to the possible motion may be indifferently called n xlmmr, an
ἐνέργεια, and, though hardly with equnl proprian an Ἰι’νι-τλέχειιι. ln the
second case, suppose we take house—building as our instance, we have
(a) the mere bibrum· or possibility of house-building, (β) the process itself,
οῐιωδομική, (γ) the remit, τὸ ἔργον, the house. Here, υἱκοδομικῆ. the pro-
cess, ought strictly speaking to be called a κίνησιε, but it is also mnedv,
though with less propriety, an ἔνι’ργιια or even an ἐμπλέχεως bnt the end
or renuit, the house itself, can only be said to exist ἐνεργείᾳ οτὲνηλεχεεᾳ,
and the latter expression seems the more appropriate of the two. The
tet-ms iuip-yna and ἐντελέχεια are often used interchangeabiy by Aristone,
but, strictly speaking, it would seem that ἐνέργεια (ἐν ἔργῳ) should be
appropriated to a motion which is an end in itself, while ἱντυλέχιια (ἐν
τέλει ἔχειν) ought to be npproprinted to the result of a motion or procas,

or to actual as opposed to possible existence.
On this distinction, the student is speclnlly recommendet! to read Tmu-

delenburg’s first note to De Anima, bk. ii. ch. 1, and to compare the pnmgeo
in Aristotle’s works, where the ternis ἐνέργεια and ἐνπλέχειιι occur. He
should notice particularly Metnph. viii. 6 and Eth. vii. 1⁴ (8). Sir Alex-
ander Grant treats of this distinction at some length in one of the Essa„
appended to his edition of Aristosse's Ethics.

‘Actus Purus: in the present passage, may mean either the proces of
development by which one material substance passos into another or the
final result which follows frum the meta-schematismos, that is to say, the
change in its structure. Thus, the-actus purus might either be the proces
by which the acm-n pasees into the oak or iron into rust, or it might be the
oak or the rust itself. Conformably to these alten-nativa, ‘lex acus uve
motus' may denote either¹ the law governing the procem by winidi the
final result is atffiued, οι· the law expressing the conditions ot· the result
itself, that is to say, it may denote either a dynamical law or a stationi
law. l am inclined to think that, in this place, lt has the former manins-
